Design documentation may include CAD drawings and bills of materials, technical design reports and presentation review notes, engineering analysis models and calculations, product test data, engineering specifications, and much more.\nAs all teams will use Subversion, checking in a design document to Subversion counts as posting a message. Please remember to also post a message to the forum indicating that new information is available at the Subversion. The forum is the place to discuss the information you placed in Subversion.\nWithin the EDN, we comment on each others work to collaborate for the purpose of improving the overall technical team output and the communication of that output. This is a work skill, part of your professional development, and is not limited to Capstone.\nThese would be in addition to the usual guidance on maintaining professional behavior, providing constructive comments, etc.\nIn the course of the design development process, individual engineers will also maintain records of the many design decisions made along the way with background, insights, and thoughts that they may have had. To maintain personal organization, many engineers will use a design notebook to record a log of meeting notes, system concept sketches, critical design parameters, engineering calculations, flow diagrams, system schematics, and any references that serve as a reminder of how and when they arrived at their design decisions. A well-organized design notebook provides an evolutionary depiction of the design development process and can serve as an official record of exactly when and how ideas may have been developed in support of potential patent claims.

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb Meetings \u00bb\nEach team is responsible to post the minutes of a meeting to EDN, typically in the Project Management forum for their project. This provides a record of the decision making processes used during the project. Meeting minutes allow missing members of your team to stay up to date. This includes your Sponsor/Mentor, Project Engineer and Chief Engineer!\nThis task should rotate among the team members, to ensure every student generates at least one memo. These minutes should summarize important activities and progress during the course of the semester and include a list of weekly assigned tasks, responsibilities for completing tasks, and estimated time and resources for completion. The team should maintain an updated list of action items as a regular component of the minutes of a meeting. It should highlight any issues that the team is facing and corresponding actions that the team is taking to solve problems. Submit the minutes of a meeting as a message in Project Management forum and avoid attaching a Word file because attachments are not searchable in the EDN.\nThere are MANY resources on the web for taking good meeting minutes - a fast search will yield many! In particular, look at the templates offered by Microsoft Word and/or Open Office - but do not take your minutes in these tools. Use a simple plain text editor instead.\nEDN's issues tool provides an excellent method for recording these action items. Simply use the \"To Do\" category and if all the fields are filled in you will have an accurate record of the who / what / when aspects for each! You can then track progress of these on EDN by simply updating the status regularly.\nDO NOT take your minutes in Word/Open Office and then attach a \"doc\" file. It is MUCH easier on the reader to see the information directly in the posting rather than having to open a document to get it. Even worse is to paste the text into the posting AND still attach the same thing as a \"DOC\" file! Now the reader has to open the attachment only to find that it's the same as the text in the posting. Posting as plain text also allows easy searching for information using EDN's search functionality.\nDO post a picture or a photo of your whiteboard as an attachment.\nA simple template has been created - export:template documents/Meeting Minutes.txt\nThis is a text file that you can edit for your meeting minutes. Please do not use word processing tools such as Word as they will introduce formatting problems. Please do NOT attach the file! Instead, copy & paste the text directly into the EDN comment box for proper formatting.\n\n",

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb\nThis is a very short intro to using the EDN. For the complete reference you should use the full Quick Start Guide below.\nIf you only read ONE document on how to use the Electronic Design Notebook (EDN), it should be the one posted above. If you want to get an \"A\" in this course and be a useful member of your team, you should review all of this page and ask your Project Engineer any questions.\nWe have created a separate page covering project management and the use of the EDN for your project Gantt Charts.\nThese tools are typically provided for all projects - please ask your Project Engineer or the system manager if they are not currently available for your project!\nThe Wiki for a project serves as it's knowledge base - much as this wiki serves as a knowledge base for the entire Capstone program. In the wiki teams can collaboratively gather information related to the project such as instructions, guidelines, techniques, processes, test plans, etc.\nWe have an example of a Typical Home Page along with more suggestions and ideas.\nIssues are used to manage things that \"come and go\" during a project, such as tasks, design errors, and implementation errors (aka \"bugs\" for the software folks). Use an issue every time a problem is identified, an error is detected, or a key piece of information had been identified as missing. Then, assign the issue to a team member who is then responsible for updating the issue as progress is made. When the issue is complete it's status is changed to reflect that and the % done is automatically updated to 100%. Using the EDN tools a user can see the list of open issues and with the filters, look for those that belong to a particular person.\nBecause the EDN includes an automatic Gantt chart feature, issues are even more important as every issue is automatically available on the project's Gantt chart. It is recommended that a specific category be used to flag issues that are intended to be seen on the Gantt chart and that using the filters, the other issues are not viewed.\nNOTE - Issues will not show up on the Gantt chart unless you enter a due date!\nYou can indicate relationships between issues in EDN. You can indicate that issue A \"precedes\" issue B, meaning that A must be completed before B. This also means that you should close the issues in that order.\nWhen closing an issue it is important to ensure that the body of issue includes a link to the location of the artifact/outputs related to the issue. This could be a repository revision number (denoted by lower case r then the revision number ex: r115), forum posting (denoted by message#12345), or a specific wiki page. Someone other than the assignee should be responsible for verifying the completeness and accuracy of the artifact/outputs before closing.\nOn the Gantt chart, these form the milestones used in project management. Issues should be tied to a \"Version\" which will properly group them on the Gantt chart.\nThe Forums, sometimes called \"Discussion Boards\", provide a place for teams to discuss the various aspects of the project. To facilitate this, a standard set of boards are created for each project. These are described in the next few sections. In general the forums are used to provide a collaborative platform for our teams. Students as well as sponsor / mentors, faculty and staff are all users of these forums. They are often used to help create a dialog among these members of the team.\nForum postings cannot be \"moved\" or deleted by students.\nTo \"end\" a thread that should continue elsewhere, simply add a \"last\" posting that indicates that the thread has ended and give the reader an indication of where to look, ex: in the Design forum, posting titled \"Topic X\". Best practice would provide a link to the new/current location of the discussion.\nThe one - two page project description should be posted in this section.\nIntroductory files from the sponsor can be posted here.\nStudents use this forum to post their contact and availability information and to coordinate team meetings held outside of class time. Status reports and minutes from all meetings should be posted here as well.\nThis forum acts as part of the team's electronic design notebook. As technical information is obtained and analyzed, it should be posted here. Team members are responsible for periodically reviewing the materials and offering insightful and constructive comments. Faculty, staff, and your sponsor/mentors will do the same!\nOnce the problem statement is partially understood, the team works toward creating Statement of Work (SoW, Phase 1 of the Design Report). Team members use this forum to post drafts of the SoW for collaborative editing and feedback. Once a version of the SoW is accepted by the Project Engineer and Chief Engineer a \"final\" version should be posted. As changes to the SoW are negotiated over the balance of the semester, those versions should be posted as well.\nThis forum is for team use when collaborating on the midterm deliverables - Poster for PDR, Preliminary Design Review PPT, & Preliminary Design Document (Phase 2 of Design Report). Drafts should be posted for review and feedback.\nThis forum is for team use when collaborating on the end of term deliverables - Poster, Final Design Review PPT, and Phase 3 of Design Report. Drafts should be posted for review and feedback.\nAttachments Below\n\n",

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb\nAll projects use the Subversion tool for version control of key project files. These are stored in a 'repository' on the same server as the Electronic Design Notebook system. All project work for a given semester is to be done in the 'working' folder (see below). At the end of the semester, each team is to create a project archive or 'tag' (see below). This tag is a snapshot of the semester's work and allows future teams to see the exact project status at the end of each previous semester.\nHow should I interact with files in SVN? - Install a Subversion Client\nI can't commit a file\nHow to run Cleanup?\nOur team wants to use Git instead of SVN\nHow to EASILY access newest version of Capstone Playbook\nInteracting with your project's Repository through a browser is possible, but cumbersome. We strongly recommend installing a Subversion Client to allow smoother file use.\nTagging creates an end of semester archive of your repository.\nIt is CRITICAL to remember that there should also be threads created in the Forum to document the reasoning and discussion about files in the Repository. This will help explain to teammates, sponsor, and instructors WHY a CAD model looks like it does, or WHAT additional work is needed on a spreadsheet calculation.\nAll our repositories are managed by EDN and can be found at: https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/svn2/repo-name/working where repo-name is the name of your repository.\nWith EDN, repositories are automatically created when new projects are defined. The name of your repository is the same as the project's identifier. To determine the project identifier, simply look at the URL for your project. For THIS project, the URL is: https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/working and \"capstone-support-dev\" is the identifier. If it had one, this project's working repository would be found at: https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/svn2/capstone-support-dev/working\nFor security control, your EDN username and password are used to access the repository for your project.\nThis initial folder structure is created by your Project Engineer at the start of a project. Future teams will then use that existing folder structure.\nThe concept of a \"working\" folder is that it is there for the entire life of a project. Whether the current team happens to need every file or not. It does NOT represent the currently semester's \"working\" folder. Some things that are clearly historical only, like background memos can be deleted after they are 'tagged'. Other things like the posters and reports are simply overwritten each semester with the latest and greatest since they too have already been tagged.\nWorking Folder Structure\nMany of our projects run across multiple semesters with each new team broadly continuing the work of the previous team. Our projects in EDN are thus set up to support this. They are NOT set up on a semester by semester basis. The working folder will be where all of the project's (from all the semesters) active work will be saved. Your working folder is part of the technology transfer for your project.\nPLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLDER STRUCTURE!\nWithin the working folder we use a \"functionally\" oriented folder structure:\nThe Tag folder is used to create \"snapshots\" of a project. Projects are tagged by the Project Engineer ONLY at the end of each semester after a thorough review. Students should NOT do the tagging.\nIf in doubt, please ask your Project Engineer BEFORE you make organizational changes to an existing repo.\nIf you are not absolutely sure about how to proceed, ASK your Project Engineer before you make any changes!\nConsult your faculty advisors on archiving any proprietary information obtained from the project sponsor.\nEvery folder should include a README file to help explain to the contents.\nAttachments Below\n\n",

Unfortunately, we have not been able to get svnx to work on the Monterey release (12.0) of the Mac OS.\nInstructions for downloading and using svnx can be found here.\nAn alternative for users with the Monterey release of the Mac OS is to use the free version of SmartSVN (https://www.smartsvn.com/). Please note that we have no experience nor training material for this. Your PE or team mates can help if you are having trouble working out the proper URL for your team's repo.\nThe fallback is to install the command line subversion utility. A very limited set of commands are needed.\nThese steps are to be done ONCE in your terminal window:\nIf you have trouble executing these commands, please reach out to Mark Anderson during his office hours for support.\nFor Linux, the recommended client is RabbitVCS which can be downloaded from: http://www.rabbitvcs.org/.

Although file names should be meaningful, any that are not should be commented on in the README. Don't just restate the folder name in words in the README - explain it instead!\nGenerally README files are plain text files NOT WORD documents.

In general, you can either post the file or files as an attachment to an issue, to a forum or to the wiki. Alternatively, you can place files in the projects' repository. You can then use a link to the file in your forum posting / wiki page / issue. EDN text formatting supports \"r252\" which will automatically create a link to revision 252. See the Subversion wiki page for information on how to use the repository.\nIn general, DO NOT compress files / folders to be placed in the repository - there should be no need to do so and it makes using / browsing the repository more challenging.\nYou can compress the files to reduce their size. It is possible to create a compressed \"ZIP\" file of a single file, multiple files or even an entire directory. Support for ZIP files is readily available in both Windows and LINUX.

It is fairly granular - meaning that you can choose to watch individual things that you are particularly interested in rather than needing to watch and see \"everything\". Look for the \"Watch\" link at the top of wiki pages.\nOn Issues you are automatically set as a watcher for any issue you create. You can also add other team members as watchers when you create a new issue. When viewing an issue that you did not create, you can choose to watch/unwatch the issue by clicking that link near the top of the page. When viewing an existing issue you cannot add other team members as watchers.\nFor Forum posts, you can add yourself as a watcher but can not add someone else.\nEDN also supports RSS Feeds. You can subscribe to your project with your favorite RSS reader and be automatically provided with updates on project activity. On some pages this is shown as \"RSS\" on others it appears as \"Atom\" which is an alternate type of news feed. To get the best overall view of your project, subscribe to the RSS feed on the Activity tab. For the RSS feed, update entries seem to be considered using the time of creation, rather than the time they were last replied to. Therefore, if someone has just replied to an item, it will not move to the top of your RSS feed.\n\n",

We do expect, however, that many students will work within a project oriented job setting or that a future job setting might benefit from adopting project management techniques.\nThe resources below are intended primarily to expose you to the benefits and the language & terminology used in project management.\nThere are many articles on this topic - some for training purposes to help people become project managers or to further develop their skills, some to help explain why a company should have or employ project managers and some that are introductory.\nThe selection of resources listed here are intended only to help explain why applying project management is important.\nThere is no shortage of videos on project management. Some focus on the career path of a project manager, some focus on justifying why one is need and there are many tutorials and on-line courses about project management that are intended to help individuals learn these skills.\nThe video(s) below are intended to help you understand why project management is important and why we feel that students should develop some basic project management skills.\nThe purpose of the Gantt chart is to facilitate a successful project. It is to help team members communicate among themselves to their project sponsors/mentors and to their Chief and Project Engineers. It is NOT a homework assignment to be done and forgotten! It IS a living document that must be updated and maintained regularly, adding new items as they are identified and updating the status of existing items. It will show who is the owner of each task and when it is due / available so that others can plan their own work.\nIt is a tool for teams to help hold team members accountable for their work - in terms of quantity, timeliness and quality.\nOne of the first steps to project planning is to create a Work Breakdown Structure. This document Sample_WBS_by_Task_Types.pptx will show a sample WBS. We recommend that you do a brief web search for other examples and more information.\nThese are the major deliverables of your project. EDN calls these \"Versions\". Be sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these! Milestones are reached by achieving a series of tasks (see below). Milestones represent an all or nothing measurement. Either your team has reached the milestone or they have not!\nThis website has some helpful information on understanding what makes a milestone: https://www.ittoolkit.com/how-to-it/projects/project-milestones.html\nThese are the steps you must take to get from one milestone to another. Each task represents a measurable chunk of work. As a result, a team can measure it's progress toward a milestone by examining the individual tasks required to get there. EDN calls these 'Issues' and will automatically calculate the percentage of issues completed to reach a given milestone.\nBe sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these!\nThis file can be printed on 11x17 paper. It has rows for each team member's name and columns for several weeks. Each team member can then fill in what they plan to do for each week to contribute to the project.

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb\nThis is a very short intro to using the EDN. For the complete reference you should use the full Quick Start Guide below.\nIf you only read ONE document on how to use the Electronic Design Notebook (EDN), it should be the one posted above. If you want to get an \"A\" in this course and be a useful member of your team, you should review all of this page and ask your Project Engineer any questions.\nWe have created a separate page covering project management and the use of the EDN for your project Gantt Charts.\nThese tools are typically provided for all projects - please ask your Project Engineer or the system manager if they are not currently available for your project!\nThe Wiki for a project serves as it's knowledge base - much as this wiki serves as a knowledge base for the entire Capstone program. In the wiki teams can collaboratively gather information related to the project such as instructions, guidelines, techniques, processes, test plans, etc.\nWe have an example of a Typical Home Page along with more suggestions and ideas.\nIssues are used to manage things that \"come and go\" during a project, such as tasks, design errors, and implementation errors (aka \"bugs\" for the software folks). Use an issue every time a problem is identified, an error is detected, or a key piece of information had been identified as missing. Then, assign the issue to a team member who is then responsible for updating the issue as progress is made. When the issue is complete it's status is changed to reflect that and the % done is automatically updated to 100%. Using the EDN tools a user can see the list of open issues and with the filters, look for those that belong to a particular person.\nBecause the EDN includes an automatic Gantt chart feature, issues are even more important as every issue is automatically available on the project's Gantt chart. It is recommended that a specific category be used to flag issues that are intended to be seen on the Gantt chart and that using the filters, the other issues are not viewed.\nNOTE - Issues will not show up on the Gantt chart unless you enter a due date!\nYou can indicate relationships between issues in EDN. You can indicate that issue A \"precedes\" issue B, meaning that A must be completed before B. This also means that you should close the issues in that order.\nWhen closing an issue it is important to ensure that the body of issue includes a link to the location of the artifact/outputs related to the issue. This could be a repository revision number (denoted by lower case r then the revision number ex: r115), forum posting (denoted by message#12345), or a specific wiki page. Someone other than the assignee should be responsible for verifying the completeness and accuracy of the artifact/outputs before closing.\nOn the Gantt chart, these form the milestones used in project management. Issues should be tied to a \"Version\" which will properly group them on the Gantt chart.\nThe Forums, sometimes called \"Discussion Boards\", provide a place for teams to discuss the various aspects of the project. To facilitate this, a standard set of boards are created for each project. These are described in the next few sections. In general the forums are used to provide a collaborative platform for our teams. Students as well as sponsor / mentors, faculty and staff are all users of these forums. They are often used to help create a dialog among these members of the team.\nForum postings cannot be \"moved\" or deleted by students.\nTo \"end\" a thread that should continue elsewhere, simply add a \"last\" posting that indicates that the thread has ended and give the reader an indication of where to look, ex: in the Design forum, posting titled \"Topic X\". Best practice would provide a link to the new/current location of the discussion.\nThe one - two page project description should be posted in this section.\nIntroductory files from the sponsor can be posted here.\nStudents use this forum to post their contact and availability information and to coordinate team meetings held outside of class time. Status reports and minutes from all meetings should be posted here as well.\nThis forum acts as part of the team's electronic design notebook. As technical information is obtained and analyzed, it should be posted here. Team members are responsible for periodically reviewing the materials and offering insightful and constructive comments. Faculty, staff, and your sponsor/mentors will do the same!\nOnce the problem statement is partially understood, the team works toward creating Statement of Work (SoW, Phase 1 of the Design Report). Team members use this forum to post drafts of the SoW for collaborative editing and feedback. Once a version of the SoW is accepted by the Project Engineer and Chief Engineer a \"final\" version should be posted. As changes to the SoW are negotiated over the balance of the semester, those versions should be posted as well.\nThis forum is for team use when collaborating on the midterm deliverables - Poster for PDR, Preliminary Design Review PPT, & Preliminary Design Document (Phase 2 of Design Report). Drafts should be posted for review and feedback.\nThis forum is for team use when collaborating on the end of term deliverables - Poster, Final Design Review PPT, and Phase 3 of Design Report. Drafts should be posted for review and feedback.\nAttachments Below\n\n",

        "content": "Course Guidelines and Policies \u00bb Task Guidelines \u00bb\nYour team will prepare a brief project background description that identifies relevant stakeholders and describes the benefits that they will receive if you are successful with your project, referred to as the Statement of Work, or SoW. This is Phase 1 of the development of the team's Design Report. The Statement of Work is comprised of Sections 1, 2, 3, and Appendix A of the Design Report, covering the following four topics:\nWhen you are saving your \"Design Report.docx\" file, do NOT rename it! It will continue to have that file name throughout the semester. Please be sure to place it in the \"Reports/Design Report + Poster\" folder in the repository with that name. All revisions should be done using the repository.\nIn the above software example, the \"agile\" item is not as technically interesting as the \"iterative release\" aspect since it is assumed that teams will use good project management techniques. Do not just list the names of software packages / engineering tools. Instead describe how you will apply them in the context of your project. Do not simply re-state the generic steps of the design process - make this unique to your specific project.\nOnce you have your deliverables defined in the Statement of Work, one team member should follow the instructions found on the Self-learning Materials page to create the Versions (also called milestones) within the EDN for your team. Everyone will need these when they begin to enter their Issues as each Issue needs to be tied to it's appropriate Version.\n\n",

Be sure all terms are clear or defined.\nFor Background and Motivation you should pull heavily from your project description and changes or new information (if any) from your sponsor meeting.\nFor Long Term Objectives and Customer Payoff think about what your customer is trying to do with your results that will mean better products, higher profits, contributions to society, etc. Probably your work will need to be combined with other developments, in follow-on work at RPI or at the customer's development labs, before that benefit is actually realized. This might be their 2-5 year plan. It is the 'big picture'. Your current semester's work is a bite sized chunk of that big picture. The part that many students get hung up on is the difference between \"Long Term Objective\" and \"Current Semester Objectives and Customer Payoff.\"\nCurrent Semester Objectives are the valuable results that you will produce and deliver to your customer in this one-semester course. As you can imagine, your grade will be in large part determined by how delighted your customer is with those results. These should include specific commitments by your team and should be project specific, not generic. Do NOT simply repeat the generic design process. If you are working on an on-going project, summarize the project history first so that it is easy for the readers to understand why you chose the semester objectives.\nThe Engineering Tools and Methods section should provide specific information on the technical aspects of work. It should convince the reader that the team has the technical know-how required to execute the project. Do not include project management approach details unless they specifically relate to how the team will deliver their work. Some examples are shown in the table below.\nAnother pitfall is to fill the Deliverables and Dates list with course items, like the Preliminary Design Document or sponsor visits / field trips. This list is instead intended for completion of specific intermediate project accomplishments (like analysis, experiments, design drawings or fabrication of parts) that will lead to the deliverables needed to satisfy the Current Semester Objectives. Make sure to include deliverables that are tangible items. Leverage the S.M.A.R.T. approach (described elsewhere in the wiki). Be sure that your deliverables are project specific rather than generic. They are the output of the tasks, not the task themself. The deliverables should relate to the items you identified in the Current Semester Objectives section ex: when will you deliver on those objectives. Schedule your deliverables to leave the last week of classes free for you to complete the academic requirements, ex: the final report, project archive, shop cleanup, etc.\nTask: Research competitors' products.\nDeliverable: A report on competing products.\nTask: Research competitors' products.\nDeliverable: A report on competing products.\n"

This will provide a solid technical foundation that is critical for project success.\nWhen engineers start working on a new project, the first order of business is to become familiar with the past work, terminology, and available information about the area. Prior to meeting with customers and stakeholders, engineers collect and organize their understanding of past work to help establish tentative project objectives and plans. This initial research is used to help frame appropriate questions for discussion with project sponsors, stakeholders, and colleagues/teammates.\nWhile all of your projects require creativity and innovation, chances are very good that technologies and/or system concepts already exist that you can modify and adapt to the needs of this particular project. As the old saying goes, it does not make much sense to \u201creinvent the wheel.\u201d With this in mind you should meet with your team and list the key areas where understanding of existing technologies is critical to the success of your project.\nThe topic of your background memo does NOT represent your assignment for the entire semester, only for this first individual deliverable. Once the team has shared the background memos from each person, teams can and should assign team members to tasks based on skills and interests. When acting as a \"team\", individuals will naturally assist each other in accomplishing the project work.\nEach individual student must submit a free-standing memo (4 pages double-spaced) summarizing your findings to the team and project mentors. Students must follow the steps below. Please use MicroSoft Word to produce the memo. Post the original editable Word document as an attachment to an EDN Forum post - Do NOT post the contents of the Word document in the post.\nThe purpose of the background memo is to help get you acquainted with the technical material and to increase the team\u2019s knowledge on the topics.

        "content": "Course Guidelines and Policies \u00bb Task Guidelines \u00bb\nDesign reviews are an opportunity to share information and get feedback as part of an open and honest dialog with reviewers. They are often used in practice to determine whether a project should proceed forward to the next stage in the development process. The preliminary design review consists of a poster-based design review and a preliminary design report.\nA poster-based design review is an interactive process. It should not be a \"rehearsed\" presentation where you read off note cards or a script. Use the elevator pitch taught in PD3 to present a big picture of the project at the beginning of a review session.\nStudents should expect an in-depth discussion between themselves and reviewers/audience - including answering specific questions that arise, offering demonstrations if possible, etc. Use the poster as a visual aid to show data and strengthen concepts, not as a slide show.\nThe Preliminary Design Review (PDR) is poster based, NOT based on a PowerPoint presentation like the status update meetings. Prepare a poster in PowerPoint (Microsoft or Open Office / Libre Office) format that team members will use to explain the project to interested students and faculty, most of whom will have no prior knowledge of the project. DO NOT use Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Visio, Google Docs, Google Sheets or ANY other software packages! The template page setup is 3 feet by 4 feet in landscape mode. Two posters will not be allowed. If your team needs more space (because of a large team with distinct sub-teams), consult with your Project Engineer and Chief Engineer. See below for the suggested contents.\nThere will be three shifts during class time. Every student must present at least once. Create three sub-teams, and each sub-team will have 20 minutes to describe your project and project plan with at least 5 minutes for Q&A. Reviewers may ask questions DURING the flow of the presentation. This may make presenters uncomfortable but is much better to transmit information. If the audience is confused, that can be cleared up immediately rather than continuing without understanding, i.e., real time feedback. This also prevents useful questions or suggestions from being forgotten before the end of the presentation time.\nEach sub-team will cover the entire project, so it is best to divide your team into balanced sub-teams. You will be evaluated as individuals on communication skills, including but not limited to: oral presentation, using a poster, and answering questions.\nDownload your poster file to your computer and use a desktop version of PowerPoint. You can turn the shape of a cursor to a red laser pointer to draw attention to a part of your poster.\nEach sub-team should also have a designated Note Taker for each shift. This person will not present material or answer questions but document comments and suggestions the audience may offer. This note should be uploaded to the EDN and shared with the full team after class. If necessary, a student(s) can repeat in this role. However, (again) each team member MUST present during at least one shift.\nTeam members who do not present the poster during each shift will attend other presentations by a different capstone team. Make sure to turn off your webcam and microphone.\nTurn on your web camera if at all possible. Have an appropriate background.\nThe standard for the preliminary design review is Business casual. For more information, see presentation attire guidelines.docx\nPrepare a poster that team members will use to explain the project to reviewers who may not have prior knowledge of the project. The poster should be mostly pictures, diagrams and graphs. Most of the words will be filled in by you. If you put in the effort and are well prepared, introducing your project to reviewers using your poster will be easy, rewarding and fun. Much of this information should already be in your Statement of Work! Do not start from scratch - just re-use that information!\nPlease include the following in your poster:\nBe sure to include some graphics or discussion of overall System Architecture. Flow chart of a process, sketch of fixture with part in machine, or product within use environment helps to communicate the big picture.\nPlease see Creating Posters for suggestions on preparing your poster. Be sure to review your proposed poster with your Project Engineer the week before it is due so that you can get feedback and still have time to make revisions. Again, check with your Project Engineer and Chief Engineer for guidance on what is best for your particular project.\n\n",

Whether or not the project is new to RPI, you should include some illustration of past work by others on this problem. This information should already be in your Statement of Work!\nCurrent Semester Objectives (System Requirements) - What will your team accomplish this semester? Include a bullet list of the key deliverables along with some sort of \u201csystem diagram.\u201d Be sure to specify any quantitative requirements that your deliverables will need to meet. As much as possible, objectives must be specific and measurable. This information should already be in your Statement of Work!\nTechnical Approach, Results, and Accomplishments up until this review - This is project dependent. If you have built an early prototype, show a picture or design drawing. If you have done tests and measurements, present graphs, and be prepared to discuss what the results mean. If you have done technology trade-off studies, show the key results. If you have done calculations show key results -- graphs are good, equations should be used sparingly. Be ready to explain the significance of your results. This is your opportunity to show your progress toward achieving project success.\nNext Steps and Plan - Include words and illustrations that indicate how you will meet your semester objectives. What engineering tools and methods will be used? DO NOT include a detailed planning chart (such as a Gantt Chart). Think carefully about the words you used to describe your plan. Include any special challenges or equipment needs. You should also talk about societal, safety, and ethical issues. The time frame for these steps and plan is current semester. Work to be done by the next team or sponsor will be mentioned on final poster.\n"

You can verbally describe during presentations. Audience can move closer to inspect/understand afterwards.\nReview your poster before sending it to a plotter. Print a poster on a letter size paper (8.5\" x 11\") using a color printer. Keep your arms straight and hold the sheet. This simulates the condition of a reviewer reading your 3\u2019 by 4\u2019 poster when you are standing in front of your poster. Make sure that it is easy to read and that the color scheme is working. Avoid complex backgrounds because they can distract from your message. Using a simple white background is almost always the best choice.\nWhen printing, DO NOT use glossy paper! This is more expensive, takes longer to dry, and is often more difficult to read due to glare from lighting in the room.\nIt often takes three or more hours to print and dry a poster. It is a good idea to send your print job to a plotter at least one day before your presentation. Information about the plotters in the VCC is at this link: http://helpdesk.rpi.edu/update.do?catcenterkey=78\nHang your poster before the class!\nBe sure to post both the source file and a pdf file on the EDN. The source file is needed to create a final poster at the end of a semester, and for anyone else to edit.\nOnly PowerPoint should be used to create the poster. Tools such as Microsoft Publisher, Visio, Draw.io, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and similar tools are not to be used as not everyone has these tools. Web based tools are not to be used because the project's IP would then be stored in a non-RPI cloud system.\nCost of plotting poster will NOT be reimbursed through team budget.\nMost Project Engineers (Anderson, DeBoer, Paster) department affiliation is 'CORE'.\n"

All of the prior steps have lead to this point where your team will present the final report, which includes both a written technical report and oral presentation.\nThe written report and final presentation should be prepared in cooperation with all members of the project team.

In this regard, the team should prepare a summary work breakdown structure for both the report and presentation that clearly indicates individual contributions.\nThe Final Design Review is a PowerPoint-based design review. It will be scheduled in cooperation with your project mentor and evaluator for some time during the last two weeks of the semester. In some cases, the design review may be scheduled during the reading days or during finals week. One to two hours should be allocated for the review. The audience will include sponsors, mentors, advisors, evaluators, and consultants associated with the project.\nThe dress code for the final design review is business casual.\nFinal review is NOT simply the final status update.

Purchasing related forms can be found at: Purchasing Guidelines.\nOne of the educational goals of the Capstone Design course is increase student\u2019s awareness of the need to protect confidential technical information. The Sponsorship Agreement (SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT 11-15-13.pdf) describes the rules for handling information provided by the sponsor that is explicitly marked \u201cconfidential\u201d. Guidelines are also given for publication of project results.\nIt is rare that our projects require explicitly identified confidential information. It is therefore important to recognize that ALL the technical information in our projects should be given appropriate protection. The general rule is that we should share information only when it is in the best interest of the project, or when it serves appropriate educational goals. It is also acceptable to discuss appropriate project information when applying for jobs. But be aware that interviewers will respect your professionalism for limiting the information about the sponsor\u2019s project that you are willing to discuss with another company.\nA specific issue concerns the use of Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and possibly other \u201cfree\u201d e-mail services to exchange project technical information. Google, Yahoo and others may scan their email in the process of attaching relevant advertising or for marketing analysis. The risk for the release of confidential information is a matter of debate. But any such risk can be avoided by using RPI e-mail or the EDN system. The Capstone course policy is to NOT include any project technical information in messages to or from Gmail or other non-RPI addresses. Note that this risk still exists if you are forwarding all of your RPI email to a Google email account - this is not permitted.\nATTACHMENTS BELOW\n\n",

Fritzing CAN be used to create schematics but is discouraged in favor of EagleCAD or KiCAD.\nDfrobot : used by one of the faculty a lot for quantity 10-150 boards - very affordable.\nelefreaks (overseas) can get them from 11 days standard down to about 7 for a price - this is for multiple boards\n4PCB (US) has fast turnaround, usually small quantity, may be costly but good results\nBayAreaCircuits : http://instantdfm.bayareacircuits.com - very professional service, fast service (down to 1 day turnaround at a price!), or to mass produce a particular board. Suggest using DIPTRACE CAD software, as you get a better deal than going to them directly. Through DIPTRACE, there is a $35 dollar minimum (5/8/14), and the following specs apply:\n0.062 thick\nFR4 (standard temp for 2 layers, high temp for 4-6 layers)\n5/5 min trace and space\nHASL finish\n0.010 smallest finished hole size\ngreen solder mask - You can choose your own color solder mask by going directly to the company, but you will pay dearly for this\nThey have student deals but they aren't that great.

OSH waits until they have enough different designs on a panel and then send off to the fab. They save a lot of money this way and pass that on to the consumer. Of course the turnaround time is usually 2-3 weeks. For 2-layer board, $5 per square inch, and for 4-layer $10 per square inch.

        "content": "Purchasing Guidelines \u00bb\nYour purchasing process always starts with your Project Engineer. Our goal is, as quickly as possible, to approve purchases that will be appropriate for your project! This is what you should expect to see at your future jobs whether in industry or academia! (you may have already seen it in clubs and Greek organizations.)\nThe purpose of defining customer needs is so that we can determine the multiple technically based project requirements that are needed to meet those customer needs.\nFrom the technically defined project requirements, we create multiple concepts for addressing those. We can then establish the criteria needed to make or buy key project components.\nWhen we are asked to approve any purchase, we do so only after looking at the proposed concept and the requirements it is intended to address. Only then can we begin to determine if the proposed purchase is the appropriate one! Please note that urgency is rarely a criteria used for approving purchases!\nPlease note:\nTeams need more than just a concept! Teams need a concrete design documented that fully shows how the items will be used (schematic, CAD, etc.) as well as supporting analysis showing how/why the item will work within the overall system. In terms of the design process, this usually means passing through concept generation and selection and getting into detailed design - before ordering parts, especially expensive ones.\nIn general, we do not need to purchase parts to see \"if they work\". Commercial parts are sold to meet their manufacturer's specs. We also do not generally order parts to see \"if or how easily they can be integrated\". Instead we use the available data sheet information for this.\nTo save time, money, and frustration all around, the Project Engineers all perform this review as part of the approval process. Our only goal is to help you get the right parts that your team can actually use to move your project forward. We do this based on the design process artifacts that are taught in IED and then used in Capstone, and more importantly, later in most of your careers.\n\n",

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb\nAll CAD must be approved by your Project Engineer PRIOR to fabrication - whether the student team is fabricating things yourself or having our shop do the fabrication. Schedule an office appointment with your Project Engineer for this review. In general, for final approval, hard copy drawings are required. Preliminary discussions may be done with the model in CAD.\nThis diagram shows the general process:\nMore information about creating the required diagrams and documentation can be found in the following sections.\nIt is important to create documentation for the individual circuits within a project as well as an interconnection or system level diagram to explain how the pieces go together. The attached scanned pages ( engineering-design-pages.pdf ) provide some drafting samples from a textbook, \"Engineering Design for Electrical Engineers\". This is NOT a template for any reports / memos - just a sample of some typical schematics.\nThese are not meant as definitive tutorials, only as samples of drawings from the industry.\nThese are typically created as DWG format documents.\nA lightweight, free application \"DRAFTSIGHT\" can be used to create, edit, and view pure 2D DWG files. The link for this is below:\nhttp://www.3ds.com/products/draftsight/free-cad-software/\nNX, Bentley Microstation, and AutoCAD can also be used to create these.\nIf you have any questions, please contact Jeff Morris - morrij5@rpi.edu\nThese are typically created using custom software, akin to CAD packages for mechanical part/assembly documentation.\nFor Capstone use, a PowerPoint slide can be used to describe connections and flows.\nBe sure to use the industry standard symbols for components within the system. Both to get students accustomed to them, and so that when someone in the industry finally looks at them, it makes sense to them.\nA document with typical components in Micrsoft Word format can be found here - http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Hydraulic_Symbol_Library\nPneuDraw is a simple free software package to draw pneumatic circuits - https://www.smc.eu/en-eu/products/engineering-tools/pneumatic_circuits_drawing\nStick to the standard RPI issued software.\nOutput files should be in a format readable by the standard programs we uses, i.e. Microsoft Office. For example, image files should be JPG, PNG or GIF format.\nUse only one of the two campus standards - NX or Solidworks for the project. If your project is an ongoing one, please use the same CAD package as the previous team(s). Check with your team & Project Engineer to see which version should be used. Please DO NOT use any AutoCAD product including Inventor as this is not widely used on our campus at this time. People who already have either of the campus standard packages (NX / Solidworks) do not want/need to install yet another package. We are looking for maximum compatibility from semester to semester. The only exception would be if your sponsor requires an AutoCAD product. If so, then consult your Project Engineer.\nAny assemblies designed or to be fabricated by the team should be represented in a complete physical drawing package. These prints may be handed over to machinists here on campus, made by students within the team, or sent off to outside vendors for fabrication. It is vital that packages are complete and free of ambiguity, to prevent mistakes and speed production. Leaving off a dimension may cause multiple days of delay as the question makes it to the team, and then the answer goes back to the fabricator. Assembly drawings also communicate your design to your sponsor and to future teams.\nApply as much foresight as possible, and design the technical drawing packet with the perspective of an outside viewer and far more importantly, the machinist in mind. Using existing drawing standards, ex: ANSI, helps with this communication. Having the design formulated in one\u2019s mind, it is most common to exclude details/ reasoning that might otherwise be absolutely vital in understanding and visualizing the design at hand.\nBecause we are in the United States, commonly available hardware and materials are \"imperial\", i.e. in inches rather than metric. Unless specifically required by your sponsor, DO NOT use metric dimensions, metric hardware, or metric raw material in your design. This will only increase cost and complexity of fabrication.\nA past student Capstone project is presented as an example of a complete drawing package. This package is good, though by no means perfect. It is annotated with explanations of what is present, and corrections of some common issues. ( Example_Capstone_Drawing_Package_V2.0.pptx )\nCAD Templates are available for both NX and SolidWorks with appropriate title blocks for Capstone Projects.\nCapstone Drawing Guidelines details the required aspects of CAD drawings - Excel or PDF\nPlease review ALL drawings submitted for manufacturing against this checklist. This should help guide you to create complete and useful drawings of your components and assemblies. Expect your project engineer to review your prints against this checklist prior to authorizing production.\nFor schematic capture and PCB making there are numerous tools. These have been documented elsewhere in this wiki:\nElectronics Layout and Circuit Board Production\n\n",

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb\nAll CAD must be approved by your Project Engineer PRIOR to fabrication - whether the student team is fabricating things yourself or having our shop do the fabrication. Schedule an office appointment with your Project Engineer for this review. In general, for final approval, hard copy drawings are required. Preliminary discussions may be done with the model in CAD.\nThis diagram shows the general process:\nMore information about creating the required diagrams and documentation can be found in the following sections.\nIt is important to create documentation for the individual circuits within a project as well as an interconnection or system level diagram to explain how the pieces go together. The attached scanned pages ( engineering-design-pages.pdf ) provide some drafting samples from a textbook, \"Engineering Design for Electrical Engineers\". This is NOT a template for any reports / memos - just a sample of some typical schematics.\nThese are not meant as definitive tutorials, only as samples of drawings from the industry.\nThese are typically created as DWG format documents.\nA lightweight, free application \"DRAFTSIGHT\" can be used to create, edit, and view pure 2D DWG files. The link for this is below:\nhttp://www.3ds.com/products/draftsight/free-cad-software/\nNX, Bentley Microstation, and AutoCAD can also be used to create these.\nIf you have any questions, please contact Jeff Morris - morrij5@rpi.edu\nThese are typically created using custom software, akin to CAD packages for mechanical part/assembly documentation.\nFor Capstone use, a PowerPoint slide can be used to describe connections and flows.\nBe sure to use the industry standard symbols for components within the system. Both to get students accustomed to them, and so that when someone in the industry finally looks at them, it makes sense to them.\nA document with typical components in Micrsoft Word format can be found here - http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Hydraulic_Symbol_Library\nPneuDraw is a simple free software package to draw pneumatic circuits - https://www.smc.eu/en-eu/products/engineering-tools/pneumatic_circuits_drawing\nStick to the standard RPI issued software.\nOutput files should be in a format readable by the standard programs we uses, i.e. Microsoft Office. For example, image files should be JPG, PNG or GIF format.\nUse only one of the two campus standards - NX or Solidworks for the project. If your project is an ongoing one, please use the same CAD package as the previous team(s). Check with your team & Project Engineer to see which version should be used. Please DO NOT use any AutoCAD product including Inventor as this is not widely used on our campus at this time. People who already have either of the campus standard packages (NX / Solidworks) do not want/need to install yet another package. We are looking for maximum compatibility from semester to semester. The only exception would be if your sponsor requires an AutoCAD product. If so, then consult your Project Engineer.\nAny assemblies designed or to be fabricated by the team should be represented in a complete physical drawing package. These prints may be handed over to machinists here on campus, made by students within the team, or sent off to outside vendors for fabrication. It is vital that packages are complete and free of ambiguity, to prevent mistakes and speed production. Leaving off a dimension may cause multiple days of delay as the question makes it to the team, and then the answer goes back to the fabricator. Assembly drawings also communicate your design to your sponsor and to future teams.\nApply as much foresight as possible, and design the technical drawing packet with the perspective of an outside viewer and far more importantly, the machinist in mind. Using existing drawing standards, ex: ANSI, helps with this communication. Having the design formulated in one\u2019s mind, it is most common to exclude details/ reasoning that might otherwise be absolutely vital in understanding and visualizing the design at hand.\nBecause we are in the United States, commonly available hardware and materials are \"imperial\", i.e. in inches rather than metric. Unless specifically required by your sponsor, DO NOT use metric dimensions, metric hardware, or metric raw material in your design. This will only increase cost and complexity of fabrication.\nA past student Capstone project is presented as an example of a complete drawing package. This package is good, though by no means perfect. It is annotated with explanations of what is present, and corrections of some common issues. ( Example_Capstone_Drawing_Package_V2.0.pptx )\nCAD Templates are available for both NX and SolidWorks with appropriate title blocks for Capstone Projects.\nCapstone Drawing Guidelines details the required aspects of CAD drawings - Excel or PDF\nPlease review ALL drawings submitted for manufacturing against this checklist. This should help guide you to create complete and useful drawings of your components and assemblies. Expect your project engineer to review your prints against this checklist prior to authorizing production.\nFor schematic capture and PCB making there are numerous tools. These have been documented elsewhere in this wiki:\nElectronics Layout and Circuit Board Production\n\n",

They are generally very clear even though they may be very complicated. While commercial schematics often require multiple sheets, we generally encourage students to keep everything to a single sheet as its usually easier to follow.\nOn Linux you can use EagleCAD or a number of Spice related packages including Oregano and Gschem. Oregano includes a small number of device models needed to run simulations. Gschem lets you run simulations using ng-spice or GNUCAP but does not include the models.\nThere are MANY (other) tutorials for all of these as well as videos posted to YouTube. Do a little searching to find these!\nWhich is best? Much web searching indicates that NONE of these are the \"best\". All work and can be used to create a schematic which can then be turned into a PCB.

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb\nThis is a very short intro to using the EDN. For the complete reference you should use the full Quick Start Guide below.\nIf you only read ONE document on how to use the Electronic Design Notebook (EDN), it should be the one posted above. If you want to get an \"A\" in this course and be a useful member of your team, you should review all of this page and ask your Project Engineer any questions.\nWe have created a separate page covering project management and the use of the EDN for your project Gantt Charts.\nThese tools are typically provided for all projects - please ask your Project Engineer or the system manager if they are not currently available for your project!\nThe Wiki for a project serves as it's knowledge base - much as this wiki serves as a knowledge base for the entire Capstone program. In the wiki teams can collaboratively gather information related to the project such as instructions, guidelines, techniques, processes, test plans, etc.\nWe have an example of a Typical Home Page along with more suggestions and ideas.\nIssues are used to manage things that \"come and go\" during a project, such as tasks, design errors, and implementation errors (aka \"bugs\" for the software folks). Use an issue every time a problem is identified, an error is detected, or a key piece of information had been identified as missing. Then, assign the issue to a team member who is then responsible for updating the issue as progress is made. When the issue is complete it's status is changed to reflect that and the % done is automatically updated to 100%. Using the EDN tools a user can see the list of open issues and with the filters, look for those that belong to a particular person.\nBecause the EDN includes an automatic Gantt chart feature, issues are even more important as every issue is automatically available on the project's Gantt chart. It is recommended that a specific category be used to flag issues that are intended to be seen on the Gantt chart and that using the filters, the other issues are not viewed.\nNOTE - Issues will not show up on the Gantt chart unless you enter a due date!\nYou can indicate relationships between issues in EDN. You can indicate that issue A \"precedes\" issue B, meaning that A must be completed before B. This also means that you should close the issues in that order.\nWhen closing an issue it is important to ensure that the body of issue includes a link to the location of the artifact/outputs related to the issue. This could be a repository revision number (denoted by lower case r then the revision number ex: r115), forum posting (denoted by message#12345), or a specific wiki page. Someone other than the assignee should be responsible for verifying the completeness and accuracy of the artifact/outputs before closing.\nOn the Gantt chart, these form the milestones used in project management. Issues should be tied to a \"Version\" which will properly group them on the Gantt chart.\nThe Forums, sometimes called \"Discussion Boards\", provide a place for teams to discuss the various aspects of the project. To facilitate this, a standard set of boards are created for each project. These are described in the next few sections. In general the forums are used to provide a collaborative platform for our teams. Students as well as sponsor / mentors, faculty and staff are all users of these forums. They are often used to help create a dialog among these members of the team.\nForum postings cannot be \"moved\" or deleted by students.\nTo \"end\" a thread that should continue elsewhere, simply add a \"last\" posting that indicates that the thread has ended and give the reader an indication of where to look, ex: in the Design forum, posting titled \"Topic X\". Best practice would provide a link to the new/current location of the discussion.\nThe one - two page project description should be posted in this section.\nIntroductory files from the sponsor can be posted here.\nStudents use this forum to post their contact and availability information and to coordinate team meetings held outside of class time. Status reports and minutes from all meetings should be posted here as well.\nThis forum acts as part of the team's electronic design notebook. As technical information is obtained and analyzed, it should be posted here. Team members are responsible for periodically reviewing the materials and offering insightful and constructive comments. Faculty, staff, and your sponsor/mentors will do the same!\nOnce the problem statement is partially understood, the team works toward creating Statement of Work (SoW, Phase 1 of the Design Report). Team members use this forum to post drafts of the SoW for collaborative editing and feedback. Once a version of the SoW is accepted by the Project Engineer and Chief Engineer a \"final\" version should be posted. As changes to the SoW are negotiated over the balance of the semester, those versions should be posted as well.\nThis forum is for team use when collaborating on the midterm deliverables - Poster for PDR, Preliminary Design Review PPT, & Preliminary Design Document (Phase 2 of Design Report). Drafts should be posted for review and feedback.\nThis forum is for team use when collaborating on the end of term deliverables - Poster, Final Design Review PPT, and Phase 3 of Design Report. Drafts should be posted for review and feedback.\nAttachments Below\n\n",

We do expect, however, that many students will work within a project oriented job setting or that a future job setting might benefit from adopting project management techniques.\nThe resources below are intended primarily to expose you to the benefits and the language & terminology used in project management.\nThere are many articles on this topic - some for training purposes to help people become project managers or to further develop their skills, some to help explain why a company should have or employ project managers and some that are introductory.\nThe selection of resources listed here are intended only to help explain why applying project management is important.\nThere is no shortage of videos on project management. Some focus on the career path of a project manager, some focus on justifying why one is need and there are many tutorials and on-line courses about project management that are intended to help individuals learn these skills.\nThe video(s) below are intended to help you understand why project management is important and why we feel that students should develop some basic project management skills.\nThe purpose of the Gantt chart is to facilitate a successful project. It is to help team members communicate among themselves to their project sponsors/mentors and to their Chief and Project Engineers. It is NOT a homework assignment to be done and forgotten! It IS a living document that must be updated and maintained regularly, adding new items as they are identified and updating the status of existing items. It will show who is the owner of each task and when it is due / available so that others can plan their own work.\nIt is a tool for teams to help hold team members accountable for their work - in terms of quantity, timeliness and quality.\nOne of the first steps to project planning is to create a Work Breakdown Structure. This document Sample_WBS_by_Task_Types.pptx will show a sample WBS. We recommend that you do a brief web search for other examples and more information.\nThese are the major deliverables of your project. EDN calls these \"Versions\". Be sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these! Milestones are reached by achieving a series of tasks (see below). Milestones represent an all or nothing measurement. Either your team has reached the milestone or they have not!\nThis website has some helpful information on understanding what makes a milestone: https://www.ittoolkit.com/how-to-it/projects/project-milestones.html\nThese are the steps you must take to get from one milestone to another. Each task represents a measurable chunk of work. As a result, a team can measure it's progress toward a milestone by examining the individual tasks required to get there. EDN calls these 'Issues' and will automatically calculate the percentage of issues completed to reach a given milestone.\nBe sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these!\nThis file can be printed on 11x17 paper. It has rows for each team member's name and columns for several weeks. Each team member can then fill in what they plan to do for each week to contribute to the project. This can then be team reviewed and used to identify planning gaps and or overlap - Fill_In_Gantt_Chart-v4.xlsx.\nThe Project Management Institute has a large amount of information on their web site: https://pmiteach.org/\nAttachments Below\n\n",

It will still be discoverable via the EDN search box. There should always be a link or breadcrumb left as the issue is closed to lead to the location of the artifact justifying completion of the task.\n\n",

Are they important enough to bother adding to the Issues list? Short tasks that might be completed in an hour or two are often not meaningful in terms of the overall project plan.

Your issues should follow those guidelines.\nDo not add never-ending tasks like \"Project Management\" or Wiki Webmaster\". These are really roles that perform ongoing activities, not measurable tasks. If a specific task is eventually identified that can be measured and completed in a week, then add that item instead.\nDo not create parent tasks that have only one sub-task (child task).

Note that the process is similar for other releases and for other distributions. The commands shown below, however, have only been tested/verified on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS.\nThe host computer can be Windows, Linux or Mac. All of this works the same regardless of the host computer details which is part of the power of using virtual machines (VM's).\nFrom the VirtualBox GUI, create a new machine. When prompted, choose Linux for the type and Ubuntu 64bit for the operating system. Take the next few defaults. For disk space provide at least 12GB, preferably 14GM and if you have room, then allow 16GB - more if you have plans for an application that requires a lot of disk space. You CAN add disk space later. This will be explained later during the Operating system installation.\nOnce you have created the virtual machine, you essentially have your own personal computer that happens to \"live inside\" of your PC.\nBefore \"booting\" your PC, we need to adjust some settings.\nAs you would for any new PC, the operating system must now be installed. Go to the Storage section of your new virtual machine and click on the Empty item for the IDE controller. Then, using the pull down on the right, select the disk icon next to the Removable Drive and from there, Choose Optical Disk file. Locate and select the previously downloaded ISO file for the operating system you wish to install. This is equivalent to putting a disk in the DVD drive on a real PC. Select Live CD because that is how the Linux distribution media works. Note that the Design Lab standard is Ubuntu, latest version for new virtual machines.\nNow that your virtual PC is configured, you may click on the Start arrow in the GUI to \"boot\" your machine. It will now load your live disk allowing you to either try or install the operating system. In this case, we wish to Install.\nUbuntu will now present it's current set of installation questions. The defaults will mostly work fine. One exception is that we recommend the use of LVM for the disk setup. This makes it very easy to add a second disk later if your VM needs to expand.\nAll VM's built by the Design Lab will include an account for either Mark Anderson or Junichi Kanai or both. All VM's built by students will have one or both of these accounts added as a condition of hosting. Mark and Junichi will have administrator access so that e can provide support as needed.\nAll VM's should use a team-wide account to ensure that work done on the server is accessible by the entire team and later by the sponsor. The team-wide account information must appear in your team's wiki with both user name and password.\nThe team-wide account will generally be given administrator privileges so that you can install software as needed on your VM.\nIt is highly recommended that you install the Guest Editions. On the Virtual Machine's menu bar, choose Devices, then\nAt this point you will have a fully functioning virtual machine. It will NOT yet have the fixed IP address as that must be manually configured and for NAT it may have access to the network. If you chose NAT for use in a personal machine, the network may have to be enabled. If you are using Bridged to provide a server at a fixed IP address, then additional configuration is required before activation of the network.\nIf the network is working, then this can be skipped. Note - this was apparently a one-time issue, possibly caused by an early release of Ubuntu 20 as this \"fix\" has not been needed.\nIoT applications may elect to use the MQTT approach. To install this software:\n\nNote that this does not install / enable any security for MQTT. That can be added at a later time.\nUse of MQTT does NOT require LAMP installation.\nAnother typical method used for IoT applications is to use Django (see below). IoT applications can use the RESTful API implemented by Django to have their devices interact with a server. This approach is beneficial when one or more web based apps are required. Note that MQTT and Django can also both be used.\n(turn on shared clipboard bidirectional)\nNOTE - this page is revised as/when installation changes are identified, e.g. due to Ubuntu operating system updates. It represents the best information we currently have as of the last update to this page. If you learn / discover something that requires a change, please notify Mark Anderson, the page maintainer.\nWith Ubuntu installed we have the \"L\" in LAMP. Now install Apache web server, MySQL. If PHP is needed, it can be installed (not always needed but standard to \"LAMP\"). We will not perform all the steps to create a very secure server - only the minimal steps to create a working one.\nYou can access MySQL as root without a password using:\n\nThis completes the essential completion of a LAMP server, ready for other application software as needed.\nThere are some common utility applications any many more that might be project specific. This section will include some of each from which you can elect items to include.\nWorks in a manner similar to TortoiseSVN on Windows. It is accessed by right clicking within the Nautilus file manager.\n\nThe command line interface for Subversion is also installed:\n\nNote that this may already installed on Ubuntu 20. It is harmless to try to install a package if it's already installed.\nAt the command line type \"svn help\" for guidance.\nDo NOT use old instructions, such as those relating to Ubuntu 16.04, as there are enough differences to make it fail. For example, for Python 3, be sure to use venv, not the older virtualenv\nThe following commands can be copied from here and pasted into a shell script file for later edit & execution. Note that these instructions use the anderm8 account which must be changed for your individual project usage. Do not simply copy these into the command line as all of the commands involving the folder names will fail!\nThese things are done once for the system.\nThe above set up the software environment. The following would need to be done for each user account.\nThese things must be done by each user, for each separate Django project they wish to create. Here, our Django project will be called \"example\". Do NOT call your project example! DO figure out a meaningful name from the start as it is NOT easy to change it later.\nThese commands will create some of the required folder structure.\n\nThe default database for Django is sqlite. Now you must manually edit the example/settings.py file to select MySQL instead of sqlite and to set the db_name, db_user, and db_password to match the above.\nYou will then need to redo the migrations:\n\nYou will also need to recreate the superusers as their info is stored in the active database.\n\nThe account above is only given access to the database intended for Django usage. that user does NOT have the required privileges needed to create a new table for any other purposes.\nTo create other databases, you need to have root privileges as shown above. It is recommended that you create other different user names to access any other non-Django databases to help keep things modular.\nWhile the \"runserver\" approach documented above works for development purposes, the \"production\" version of the website should be set to run under Apache.\nTo serve the website available from Apache requires manual editing of the virtual host configuration file\nfound at /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf You may have to make multiple edits to that file depending on where you placed your Django project and the specific folder structure you used.\nA sample file is attached to this page that serves the sample application created above. 000-default.conf\nWhen you create the environment folder, keep it OUTSIDE your project folder. DO NOT commit the environment to your repository! That just wastes space. It takes only minutes to regenerate a fresh environment as needed - so no need to store it!\nBe sure to \"source\" your environment each time you start work. If you try to run python manage.py commands and they fail - it's probably because you forgot to do this and as a result it's attempting to use Python 2.x - which will not work with your Django Python 3.x environment.\nBe sure to \"svn update\" your working copy before you start work so that you have the most recent team work.\nAs a team, figure out what your project / app naming conventions will be ahead of time. Use meaningful names. Do NOT simply copy the above process so that all future Django projects are named iot_rpi!

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb Computers Software Hardware Networking \u00bb Virtual Machines \u00bb\nThese instructions assume that you have already installed VirtualBox and downloaded the latest Ubuntu LTS ISO. Note that the process is similar for other releases and for other distributions. The commands shown below, however, have only been tested/verified on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS.\nThe host computer can be Windows, Linux or Mac. All of this works the same regardless of the host computer details which is part of the power of using virtual machines (VM's).\nFrom the VirtualBox GUI, create a new machine. When prompted, choose Linux for the type and Ubuntu 64bit for the operating system. Take the next few defaults. For disk space provide at least 12GB, preferably 14GM and if you have room, then allow 16GB - more if you have plans for an application that requires a lot of disk space. You CAN add disk space later. This will be explained later during the Operating system installation.\nOnce you have created the virtual machine, you essentially have your own personal computer that happens to \"live inside\" of your PC.\nBefore \"booting\" your PC, we need to adjust some settings.\nAs you would for any new PC, the operating system must now be installed. Go to the Storage section of your new virtual machine and click on the Empty item for the IDE controller. Then, using the pull down on the right, select the disk icon next to the Removable Drive and from there, Choose Optical Disk file. Locate and select the previously downloaded ISO file for the operating system you wish to install. This is equivalent to putting a disk in the DVD drive on a real PC. Select Live CD because that is how the Linux distribution media works. Note that the Design Lab standard is Ubuntu, latest version for new virtual machines.\nNow that your virtual PC is configured, you may click on the Start arrow in the GUI to \"boot\" your machine. It will now load your live disk allowing you to either try or install the operating system. In this case, we wish to Install.\nUbuntu will now present it's current set of installation questions. The defaults will mostly work fine. One exception is that we recommend the use of LVM for the disk setup. This makes it very easy to add a second disk later if your VM needs to expand.\nAll VM's built by the Design Lab will include an account for either Mark Anderson or Junichi Kanai or both. All VM's built by students will have one or both of these accounts added as a condition of hosting. Mark and Junichi will have administrator access so that e can provide support as needed.\nAll VM's should use a team-wide account to ensure that work done on the server is accessible by the entire team and later by the sponsor. The team-wide account information must appear in your team's wiki with both user name and password.\nThe team-wide account will generally be given administrator privileges so that you can install software as needed on your VM.\nIt is highly recommended that you install the Guest Editions. On the Virtual Machine's menu bar, choose Devices, then\nAt this point you will have a fully functioning virtual machine. It will NOT yet have the fixed IP address as that must be manually configured and for NAT it may have access to the network. If you chose NAT for use in a personal machine, the network may have to be enabled. If you are using Bridged to provide a server at a fixed IP address, then additional configuration is required before activation of the network.\nIf the network is working, then this can be skipped. Note - this was apparently a one-time issue, possibly caused by an early release of Ubuntu 20 as this \"fix\" has not been needed.\nIoT applications may elect to use the MQTT approach. To install this software:\n\nNote that this does not install / enable any security for MQTT. That can be added at a later time.\nUse of MQTT does NOT require LAMP installation.\nAnother typical method used for IoT applications is to use Django (see below). IoT applications can use the RESTful API implemented by Django to have their devices interact with a server. This approach is beneficial when one or more web based apps are required. Note that MQTT and Django can also both be used.\n(turn on shared clipboard bidirectional)\nNOTE - this page is revised as/when installation changes are identified, e.g. due to Ubuntu operating system updates. It represents the best information we currently have as of the last update to this page. If you learn / discover something that requires a change, please notify Mark Anderson, the page maintainer.\nWith Ubuntu installed we have the \"L\" in LAMP. Now install Apache web server, MySQL. If PHP is needed, it can be installed (not always needed but standard to \"LAMP\"). We will not perform all the steps to create a very secure server - only the minimal steps to create a working one.\nYou can access MySQL as root without a password using:\n\nThis completes the essential completion of a LAMP server, ready for other application software as needed.\nThere are some common utility applications any many more that might be project specific. This section will include some of each from which you can elect items to include.\nWorks in a manner similar to TortoiseSVN on Windows. It is accessed by right clicking within the Nautilus file manager.\n\nThe command line interface for Subversion is also installed:\n\nNote that this may already installed on Ubuntu 20. It is harmless to try to install a package if it's already installed.\nAt the command line type \"svn help\" for guidance.\nDo NOT use old instructions, such as those relating to Ubuntu 16.04, as there are enough differences to make it fail. For example, for Python 3, be sure to use venv, not the older virtualenv\nThe following commands can be copied from here and pasted into a shell script file for later edit & execution. Note that these instructions use the anderm8 account which must be changed for your individual project usage. Do not simply copy these into the command line as all of the commands involving the folder names will fail!\nThese things are done once for the system.\nThe above set up the software environment. The following would need to be done for each user account.\nThese things must be done by each user, for each separate Django project they wish to create. Here, our Django project will be called \"example\". Do NOT call your project example! DO figure out a meaningful name from the start as it is NOT easy to change it later.\nThese commands will create some of the required folder structure.\n\nThe default database for Django is sqlite. Now you must manually edit the example/settings.py file to select MySQL instead of sqlite and to set the db_name, db_user, and db_password to match the above.\nYou will then need to redo the migrations:\n\nYou will also need to recreate the superusers as their info is stored in the active database.\n\nThe account above is only given access to the database intended for Django usage. that user does NOT have the required privileges needed to create a new table for any other purposes.\nTo create other databases, you need to have root privileges as shown above. It is recommended that you create other different user names to access any other non-Django databases to help keep things modular.\nWhile the \"runserver\" approach documented above works for development purposes, the \"production\" version of the website should be set to run under Apache.\nTo serve the website available from Apache requires manual editing of the virtual host configuration file\nfound at /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf You may have to make multiple edits to that file depending on where you placed your Django project and the specific folder structure you used.\nA sample file is attached to this page that serves the sample application created above. 000-default.conf\nWhen you create the environment folder, keep it OUTSIDE your project folder. DO NOT commit the environment to your repository! That just wastes space. It takes only minutes to regenerate a fresh environment as needed - so no need to store it!\nBe sure to \"source\" your environment each time you start work. If you try to run python manage.py commands and they fail - it's probably because you forgot to do this and as a result it's attempting to use Python 2.x - which will not work with your Django Python 3.x environment.\nBe sure to \"svn update\" your working copy before you start work so that you have the most recent team work.\nAs a team, figure out what your project / app naming conventions will be ahead of time. Use meaningful names. Do NOT simply copy the above process so that all future Django projects are named iot_rpi! It is NOT easy to change project or app names later!\nDo NOT work on your project as the root user! Be in \"root\" mode ONLY to make operating system changes such as installing new programs or editing the Apache site configuration file.\nFor more info on using / working with this framework, please visit the Django page.\n\n",

This will require a reboot to check / change.\nWhile the typical setup for personal virtual machines (VMs) uses the NAT network setting, that intentionally limits external access to the VM. With your host computer (laptop, desktop, etc.) on a wired ethernet, you can simply change the network setting to bridged and in the VM, turn that connection off and on again to reset it. Your virtual machine is now accessible from other PC's on your network.\nIf your computer is connected wirelessly, however, the simple \"change to bridged\" change does not work! A few other things have to be configured as outlined in this article: https://windowsreport.com/wifi-error-virtualbox/. The configuration changes require that the VM be shut down and will then only require a minute. Once the VM is rebooted, it will be available on the network.\nThe above lets you develop server software on your VM and test it from other computers or use it to interface to IoT devices like the ESP32.\n\n",

That file may NOT be in sync with the one from github and may be lagging. For example, on 11/30/2021, the JSON from GitHub allowed us to download version 2.0.6 and below of the ESP32 board support while the one from expressif only allowed us to download version 1.0.6. This WILL matter if your goal is to connect to the campus wifi. See below!\nNext go to the boards manager. Search for ESP32. Install the latest version.\nNO additional software libraries are required to implement the sample code provided with the ESP32. The board manager installs support for the ESP32 which includes many wifi and web server/HTTP functions. If you are running into issues, be sure to consider removing any additional wifi/HTTP related libraries. The various libraries from the various authors are NOT necessarily compatible with each other and experience to date shows that they are, in fact, NOT compatible! They can and will interfere with each other! To remove a library, you simply delete it from your library folder. There is not an IDE user interface tool for that.\nA similar caution applies to the many tutorials and YouTube videos - be sure they are compatible with what you are doing!\nRun this code to get the MAC address of the ESP32\nBe sure to set the baud rate of your serial monitor to 115200\n\nThe ESP board support includes network connection examples. Note that the code for connecting to campus will not work for connecting at home and code that works for home will not work on campus!\nYou can connect to either the eduroam WiFi network using the \"rcsid@rpi.edu\" format for the identity, or the rpi_wpa2 WiFi network using just the \"rcsid\" as the identify. Both require the use of the certificate method.\nThe above has been successfully used on campus as of 10/22/2021 BUT required version 1.0.6 of the ESP32 board support (see above). That sample code does NOT work with version 2.0.6 of the ESP32 board support without a few minor changes. These two lines must be changed from\n\nYou may choose to add a #define for the board support version and then place these lines inside a #ifdef / #elseif / #endif block so that a single code base can be shared within / across a team.\nUSING NET_REG FOR THIS IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY CAMPUS! You must use the above method!\nThe most convenient manner of connecting on campus is to use the above method. If you require an alternative, then this method is your only other alternative.\nThe following code connects the ESP to the WiFi. For the campus network the password field is left blank. For a home wifi network be sure to use the proper network name and password.\nMany IoT applications involve the use of a server with a RESTful API, e.g. Django. This is sample code for using an HTTP GET function for posting to a such a server. Note that depending on the server, you may alternatively need an HTTP POST command. If so, simply use http.POST in the sample below.\nThis section needs more content!\nTypically people seem to use the ESP8266 library and follow a specific set of instructions to manually modify that, making it work with the ESP32 since they are extremely similar.\nThere is apparently a newer sockets library that increases performance and reliability of the connections tho this has not been extensively tested within the Design Lab. There are also suggestions that it may NOT be compatible with some versions of the board manager file, but does work if you change the specific version installed. We do NOT have documentation nor further details at this time. Note that while this may be possibly better, the above one does work.\nThe library EspMQTTClient has been successfully used to communicate over the MQTT protocol to a virtual machine or other computer running the MQTT broker (also called server\"). Note that an ESP32 that is off campus is unable to communicate to a campus server as support for our VPN is not currently available on the ESP32 platform. For this reason, students should either install the broker on their own computer directly or create a virtual machine on which to run the broker and to perform other software development.\nIt is possible to publish or subscribe to MQTT topics from a Python program. This is very helpful for experimenting with the use of MQTT and to confirm that things are working before IoT device development is completed. This requires installation of the mosquitto-clients package.\nHere is one site that shows an example Python program for this: http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mosquitto_pub-sub-clients/\nThese are some of the helpful resources for using the ESP32 over wi-fi. There are MANY more available as web pages and YouTube videos!\nNote that the HTTPClient library is automatically installed when you add the ESP32 board. Note also that the HttpClient library is NOT the same one and is NOT code compatible! Capitalization is different in the two library names!\nThis page has instructions to avoid needing to manually press the reset button in order to download updated code to the ESP32: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/solved-failed-to-connect-to-esp32-timed-out-waiting-for-packet-header/\nPlease DO NOT solder ANYTHING to the Design Lab ESP32 boards other than header pins! Instead, just add that capacitor to your protoboard! If your loaner board already HAS the capacitor, it was installed by one of the Design Lab staff and should not be removed.\nThis website has a library for the Devkitc-v4 version of the board: https://www.snapeda.com/parts/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/Espressif%20Systems/view-part/\nInformation on how to configure your virtual machine to support using it as the server to communicate to the ESP32 can be found on the VirtualBox page.\nThe ESP32 has proved to be widely accepted and is now being packaged in many configurations beyond the DevKits. A google search will reveal many of these alternatives.\n\n",

It extends the features of HTML and JavaScript to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile application (because all layout rendering is done via Web views instead of the platform's native UI framework) nor purely Web-based (because they are not just Web apps, but are packaged as apps for distribution and have access to native device APIs).\nIn order for a cross platform iOS app to be created it needs to have and environment which supports HTML, JavaScript development which ideally has a visualizer ( Monaca IDE ).

The Django server platform directly implements a RESTful API. Instructions for building such a server are on the Building a generic Ubuntu LAMP server page.\nMore information on these and other aspects of IoT can be found online. This article from Control Engineering covers many of the essential topics:\nPLCs_power_industrial_data_integration-IoT.pdf\nNote that the assumed \"device\" is a PLC although the ESP32 (see below) can be used in it's place.\nSee these pages for more info on specific devices that have been used in the lab.\nThe common Arduino devices do not include internet capability. While there are shields available to provide that function, these are intended to work with Arduino's that have the matching headers.\nA common and less expensive alternative is to pair the Arduino with an ESP8266. The ESP8266 can be programmed to serve as a \"pass thru wi-fi modem\" which then allows the Arduino to send messages to the internet and receive the responses. Since these are simply strings of characters, no special libraries are needed for basic functions.\nWhile it can be configured in a \"pass-thru mode\" to be used in conjunction with almost any microprocessor, it is also a complete microprocessor on it's own. Due to it's limited configuration in terms of memory and I/O it is only suitable for very small applications. For our Capstone projects it is usually easier to use it in conjunction with a separate microprocessor.\nNote that it's a 3.3V device and is NOT compatible with 5V circuits / peripherals.\nThe board does NOT include a USB interface, so it cannot be programmed without an external interface. There is information on the web on how to use an Arduino to temporarily provide the interface. The alternative is a dedicated FTDI interface board which the lab does not have.\nThe board does not include any edge connectors, only solder pads. The spacing of these pads is NOT compatible with the spacing on a proroboard, adding another inconvenience to using this board.\nWhile the ESP8266 chip can connect a microprocessor to wifi, this chip can not! The NRF24L01 device can ONLY be used to talk to another NRF24L01 chip. So it's basically just a radio modem, but is NOT a wifi interface. If you are ordering parts, be careful you do not accidentally select this rather than the ESP8266. It is sometimes incorrectly marketed as an \"Arduino wifi antenna\". These are quite inexpensive, however, if you simply need a modem for remote operation. You might, however, then also need something to \"bridge\" between the NRF24L01 and the rest of your system.\nThis flexible \"Programmable System on a Chip\" has built in BLE capabilities. An interesting feature of this chip is that the I/O pins are configurable, such that a given pin may be set as either a digital I/O or an analog I/O. It has a hybrid programming environment that combines the typical C language programming as used in LITEC with a powerful schematic mode where logic and function blocks are added to a schematic. The C program can access data within the schematic! The chip can also be programmed in VHDL. While the C/schematic mode can be challenging to take advantage of, it does offer capabilities not found in other microprocessors.\nWhile the chip does not include wifi, it is possible to add an ESP8266 to provide that capability.\nThis is an even more powerful model of PSoC. Two versions are available - one with BLE and the other with both BLE and WiFi. The processor is a dual CPU ARM device providing for a very large amount of programming / processing capabilities.\nCypress altered their programming approach from the PSoC 1-5 families and the PSoC family is only available for C based programming - no schematic mode exists.\nThe programming is on the high end of challenging for most students. As a result, although the device is extremely capable, this family is not recommended for Capstone projects.\nA PLC is a programmable logic controller. These are ruggedized devices that have been used on the factory floor & in other industry applications for decades. Modern controllers now include some level of IoT support built in, such as directly implementing the MQTT protocol.\nWhile there are many possible overall system architectures used for Internet of Things projects, we find that many of our Capstone projects use a variation of this one: IoT_Generic_System_Architecture.pptx\nNote that the ESP32 can be replaced by a microprocessor + ESP8266 combination where the microprocessor can be an Arduino or almost any other make/model.\n\n",

The vendor id was determined using the \"lsusb\" command in the terminal.\nnote 2: under ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid), the mtpfs package must be compiled from source (the packaged distribution is broken, for some reason. go here to get the source:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/source/lucid/mtpfs\nFrom the note found here:\nhttp://www.gkspk.com/view/info/issues-in-android-honeycomb-3-2/\nText follows:\nIssues in Android 3.2\nSunday, 24th July 2011 by Musaul Karim\nAndroid 3.2 finally provides external storage support in actual android code, so the manufacturers don\u2019t need to patch it in. However, it is currently just read-only. That seems to have dissapointed a few people.\nOne of the biggest niggles however in Android 3.2 is they introduced a bug in intents. Its the mechanism how one activity launches another one. If there are multiple apps installed which can handle an activity (ex: if you have multiple image viewer apps), android gives you a window where you can pick which app you want to use. This bug prevents the picker window from coming up properly. Instead, the screen just darkens a little. The workaround is to rotate the device which will cause the window to come up.\nThe bug is officially documented & described here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=18638&q=label%3AVersion-3.0&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars\nHence, rotate the screen to bring up the helper application selection menu. If the tablet is in the keyboard/dock, it must be removed from the dock to rotate the display, after which the tablet can be returned to the dock. (this took me a little while to figure out --casey)\nThe following settings were derived from the information at the Help Desk web pages -- Mark\nCheck the \"Automatically download attachments when on WiFi\" if you want that.\nIf you are syncing to external accounts, ex: Google for application backup and/or email, then the Android will show you two calendars. One will be your Google calendar. The other is the built in calendar bearing the name ASUS.\nItems in the ASUS calendar can/will be synced to Outlook by using the ASUS Sync program. Items from your Google/other calendars will NOT be synced to Outlook. Creating items in any other calendar other than the ASUS one will leave you with items that don't and can't appear in Outlook. This may be mis-interpreted as a sync error when in fact all is working as designed, just not as intended! To \"fix\" the broken syncing, items have to be moved to the ASUS calender.\nUnfortunately, the Android calendar has no tool to let you change the assigned calender for a given event! A third party app called Business Calendar has a free version that WILL let you do this. Each event must be opened in turn and the calendar changed manually. Once this has been done, the tablet can be synced to Outlook and these items should now be present in the Outlook calendar.\nIf you are not using any of the other calendars, you can avoid entering data into the wrong calendar by de-selecting all calendars other than the ASUS one. This will hide any events stored in those calendars. If you need the other calendars then you'll simply have to pay attention to which calendar is set before saving the event OR using the Business Calendar app to change it afterwards.\nThe Business Calendar app seems to be friendly and nice looking with multiple widgets suitable for the tablet's home pages. It is possible to use that instead of the default Android calendar app.\n\n",

First, the Pi runs a vncviewer in listen mode. Second, the PC runs a vncserver that can push a connection to a viewer.\nDisable the screen saver / screen blanking by alterning the lightdm configiuration as found on this website: http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/2059/disable-screen-blanking-in-x-windows-on-raspbian\nEdit /etc/lightdm/lightdb.conf and add the following line to the [SeatDefaults] section:\nInstall a vncviewer:\nBased on information found at http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=43473 , put the following shell script in a file which we shall call start-viewer.sh (note that I did not bother to make it a one liner):\nand make it executable:\nThen, you must enable others to access the 0 display:\nIf xhost is not already installed you will need to do:\nThen you need to run xhost so that all nodes can get in - yes this is NOT secure!\nNote that this provides the most unsecured access! Experiment with xhost to narrow down the range of those who can output to the main X window display (screen 0).\nBy executing the following command, the vncviewer will be started and left running and will return control back to the terminal:\n\nI recommend placing this in an 'autostart' file so that the vncviewer is started every time the Pi boots and the LXDE display manager starts up. This was found at: http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=11256\nNext time you reboot the vncviewer will automatically get started!\nAt this point, the Pi is ready to display a screen from whoever connects to it! If the above command is added to the startup scripts then it will automatically get launched when the Pi boots. alternatively, you can SSH into the Pi and run that command to start the viewer.\nIt has been noted that connecting to the vncviewer does NOT cause the screensaver to 'wake up' so for this application it appears that it should be disabled.\nThe PC now needs a vncserver (NOT a vncviewer) that can connect to an existing listener. I have used tightvnc successfully for several years (on XP, Vista and now windows 7) and so I can recommend it. Download and install it from: http://www.tightvnc.com\nOnce installed, simply run the vncserver. It will place an icon in the system tray. Right click on that and choose \"Attach Listening Viewer\" and when prompted, provide the name or IP address of the node hosting the viewer, in this case the Pi. At this point your PC screen should be visible on the Pi's display. Note that if the Pi is running 1920x1080 then it may be 'larger' that your PC's display. If you run a two monitor setup on the PC, part of the second monitor's output may show up on the Pi. simply move that off screen if needed.\nWhen you are done screen sharing, simply right click on the vncserver and choose \"Disconnect all viewers\" which will drop the connection.\nIn this configuration, many PC users may connect to the same Raspberry Pi without making any changes to the Pi. ONLY one PC can connect at a time.\nThis is a standard Linux technique and is not unique to the Pi. On the Pi, you need a vncserver. One was already installed on the Wheezy distribution. If needed, you may install the tightvnc pages by using a terminal window and running:\nOnce it's installed, run the following to start the server on display 1:\nIt will prompt for a password for full access and a second one for read-only access. This starts the server with the default geometry of 1024x768.\nYou may also start multiple vncservers. For example, I can start a second server on display 2 with a higher resolution to match my PC's monitor resolution using:\n\nDoing this leaves a server running for my high resolution PC access and a default one in case I connect from some other device / PC (like an Android tablet).\nThe default for most Lijux systems including the Pi is to come up with a dynamically assigned IP address using DHCP. When using the Pi as a server, it may be more appropriate to use a fixed IP address.\nNOTE - the fixed IP shown here is already assigned to Mark Anderson (see the assignment list on Virtual Machines. You will need to obtain a new/different address for your use.\nUse your favorite editor or nano to edit /etc/network/interfaces. You must do this as superuser, so do this to make the edits:\n\nAnd comment out this line:\n\nand replace it with:\nThis does NOT work yet - BUT the correct approach is to install the vpnc client.\nYou'll need to edit the config file located in /etc/vpnc/default.conf OR COPY it to /etc/vpnc/rpi.conf\n\nIn that file, you'll need to un-commment some lines and add make changes to a few as shown below. FYI - \"psk\" means \"pre-shared key\".\nThe original default file:\n\nThe modified file when using an off campus network is shown here. If you need to use VPN from ON campus then the gateway should be vpn.wl.rpi.edu (as in wl = wireless lan).\n\nIf you do not include your RCS username and password (on the Xauth lines) it will just prompt you for that.\nFrom a terminal window use:\n\nThe above SHOULD work but does not yet appear to.

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb\nConstraints are limits on design freedom. (Dieter & Schemidt, 2007, p.92) In general, constraints may be thought of as boundaries to a project. Ulrich and Eppinger, in their book \"Product Design and Development\", identify some constrains that XEROX applied to their Lakes project. (Ulrich & Eppinger, 2012, pp.68-69)\nThere may be multiple sets of constraints. For example, one set of constraints may apply to the design process, another to the manufacturing / production phase and a third set may apply once the item has been shipped / distributed / sent out for use.\nThe categories below identify some of the possible areas where constraints may exist.\nThere are regulatory bodies such as OSHA that may impose constraints through their various rules. The existence of some of these rules may generate specific design requirements which would be documented separately from this constraint.\nAs parts or products are created, there may be constraints. These may relate to the manufacturing processes available or to the range of materials available. For example if a company wishes to produce metal products, they must have the processes appropriate for the types of metal they plan to use. Thus their capabilities becomes a constraint. They can, of course, address this by simply adding the necessary processes or by outsourcing part of the work.\nProjects do not have infinite amounts of time available to them! There are typically specific milestones that must be accomplished by specific dates. Teams also do not have unlimited human resources with which to accomplish the work. All of these form constraints to a project and must be managed properly for the success of the project.\nAdditional constraints may come from our ever more conscious awareness of the environment and a corresponding need to protect it. There may be constraints as to what emissions a factory can emit or how much is permitted. Certain emissions may be banned completely for new facilities but 'grandfathered in' for older existing ones.\nEnvironmental concerns extend beyond the earth itself. Additional environments include home / office / factory or other special locations. These may each have differing constraints on what may or may not be allowed / permitted / desired. These too should be documented as needed.\nCertain projects might have a focus on sustainability related issues. Some companies are currently looking at improving their sustainability metrics and may set certain constraints related to this.\nA given project may have directives from the company or sponsor that serve as constraints. For example, it may be a company policy to avoid use of a competitor's product whenever the company makes a similar product. Or a company may be developing a new technology and this dictate that the solution must employ that specific technology.\nAs with time and human resources, projects do not have unlimited financial resources. Your project's budget is this a constraint. It must be noted that the budgets that may apply to the design process are likely to be different from those that apply to the manufacturing / fabrication phase.\nDieter, G. E., & Schemidt, L. C.

We recommend that you set the full semester schedule, while avoiding PDR, break and holidays, as soon as possible.\nStart with an outline/overview of what is going to be covered\nTell the audience what you\u2019re going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you\u2019ve told them\nProvide a clear introduction that defines the problem statement:\nCitations or references showing/describing the need / basis for the project will help make a compelling intro\nCitations or references showing/describing the need / basis for the project will help make a compelling intro\nWhen multiple options are still under consideration (e.g. the controls system), provide a page that summarizes and compares the relative attributes of each. In some cases it is hard to compare on the basis of data \u2026 consider a decision matrix that puts weighting factors on various considerations\nIndividual slides benefit from contextual information. Most slides should be clear enough to convey their message even if the presentation is being reviewed at another time, without narration or verbal explanation.\nPresentations are often used to document processes and results in lieu of formal reports/memos, so the information should be structured for archival use as well. Most (if not all) slides should clearly identify:\nWhat information is being conveyed\nDetailed diagrams capturing what is being presented:\nOverall system layouts and diagrams (label the various components on 2d/3d layouts and photos)\nFree body diagrams (for structural systems)\nWhat is the takeaway from the information on the slide\nWhat information is being conveyed\nDetailed diagrams capturing what is being presented:\nOverall system layouts and diagrams (label the various components on 2d/3d layouts and photos)\nFree body diagrams (for structural systems)\nOverall system layouts and diagrams (label the various components on 2d/3d layouts and photos)\nFree body diagrams (for structural systems)\nWhat is the takeaway from the information on the slide\nConcluding material:\nWhat are the results/conclusions/findings\nWhat areas require further investigation/study to clarify?

What are the next steps?\nAt the end of the presentation, the audience should feel confident that the presenter(s) are subject matter experts. The data can speak for itself, but oftentimes the presenter needs to make the connections in the audience\u2019s mind and lead them to the desired conclusion in such a way that there is minimal remaining doubt or uncertainty.\nAt the end of the day your work may be judged not only by the quality of the work (the actual engineering and science), but also by the quality with which it is presented (the marketing, the narrative, the professionalism, the aesthetics).\nBe sure the cover page has the date of the meeting / conference call.\nNumber the slides - all of them. Use a font size large enough to be easily seen and a color that provides enough contrast to be readable!\nDate the slides - all of them.\nMake the font size/color to be readable.\nAvoid yellow lines / text / boxes on white backgrounds and other similar low contrast combinations.\nAvoid faint colors / light gray for fonts - you need contrast to make the text readable.\nAvoid yellow lines / text / boxes on white backgrounds and other similar low contrast combinations.\nAvoid faint colors / light gray for fonts - you need contrast to make the text readable.\nBe sure to include the Design Lab logo AND the sponsor's logo on every slide. Branding is important!\nBe concise!\nAvoid \"dear diary\" mode! Do not tell your story as time based like you would when recording in a daily journal. Avoid: we did this, then we did that, then we converted X into Y, our first version was A and now we have B... That is not the method for technical presentations .\nLabel and annotate your figures but watch out for 'craptions'.\nAvoid using too many significant figures. Just because your software outputs 10 digits does not mean they are all significant.\nUse numbers! Formulas! Diagrams! Show your engineering work!\nUse images or tables where appropriate / possible.\nUse bullets rather than paragraphs of text.\nUse images or tables where appropriate / possible.\nUse bullets rather than paragraphs of text.\nGenerally, avoid colored / image backgrounds as they tend to print poorly.\nDon't waste time on fancy slide templates! Concentrate on your technical content not the artistry of the slides!\nYou probably have too much text\nAlways have an agenda slide (see below).\nMake sure the items on it match the titles on your other slides.

Why is the slide there / what does it add? You may need to add a text box at the bottom to tell the viewer what you want them to 'take away' from the slide.\nDo not hide it in the Notes.\nDo not plan to \"tell\" those details.\nOther people may get a copy of your slides. They will NOT have heard your presentation - so they will only know what is on the face of the slides.

If the information is not on the slides, it won't help them.\nDon't just embed links to other files / forum posts/ etc. in the slides. Some people print them and that link always fails in that case. Instead, for anything critical to know during the presentation, include a short overview or summary of the materials. Then a link may be OK - but provide the actual URL, not a named hyperlink like \"More Info Here\".\nYou probably still have too many words!\nBe sure your slides are showing evidence of your use of the Design Process!\nContrary to what you may have been taught so far in terms of presentations, for technical presentations put all the information ON the face of the slide.\nBEFORE you start creating slides, identify the purpose of the slides. What do you want to convey? What do you want them to learn? What do you want them to remember? What are the most important of these?\nFor EACH SLIDE, what is the message? What do you want to convey? What do you want them to learn? What do you want them to remember? What are the most important of these? You may want/need to actually put that ON the slide to make sure it is communicated.\nShow your milestones with dates and indicate where you are towards accomplishing those.\nShow progress!\nShow accomplishments and results. Don't talk about what you are working on - talk about what you learned / got from that.\nBe specific! Use numbers where appropriate.\nIdentify anything that will prevent you from reaching the milestone.\nShow accomplishments and results. Don't talk about what you are working on - talk about what you learned / got from that.\nBe specific! Use numbers where appropriate.\nIdentify anything that will prevent you from reaching the milestone.\nAlways ask your Project Engineer to review your slides - at least 3 days before a conference call and always before you send out the slides!\nAlways send the slides to the sponsor at least 48 hours in advance to give them time to review and prep, especially if there are questions that the sponsor may need to research. It is generally not acceptable nor fair to your sponsor to send slides on the day of the call.\nTry reading your material out loud. Things sometimes read differently than they sound and vice versa!\nIf possible or if the material is 'controversial', have a dry run with your Project Engineer.\nHas the whole team reviewed this?

EACH slide should have a clear purpose and a clear message.\nEmail a LINK to the slides, not the slides. Keep the sponsors information out of the email system as much as possible. If the sponsor requests an email, fine but all OUR internal work is to be done through the Electronic Design Notebook (EDN).\nUse a PowerPoint presentation to guide conference calls and meetings.\nAvoid needing to switch between multiple documents / applications / windows / files / etc. Unless you have a demo!\nAvoid needing to switch between multiple documents / applications / windows / files / etc. Unless you have a demo!\nEnsure that the most recent version of the PPT is on EDN. This should be what you sent to the sponsor.\nYou may have additional material that you want to include but may not actually present on the call. Create a slide titled \"Additional Information\" and put all that material in the back of your slide set - like an appendix in a report would be handled.\nIdentify any help you might need from your sponsor. Note - ALWAYS speak to your Project Engineer about this BEFORE you show/tell the sponsor! We might be able to help and not need to ask the sponsor.\nIdentify any help you might need from your sponsor.

If the previous speaker already said the things covered on the slide you are about to cover, do NOT repeat everything just so that you can be the one who spoke to 'your' slide! They are all, in fact, TEAM slides and it does not greatly matter WHO speaks to a given slide. In general, we DO care that everyone participates in the presentation but we are not logging \"minutes talking\" nor \"# of slides presented\" for each member of the team.\nTurn your mouse into a laser pointer - Remote persons can also see an item you are pointing easily.

We mention these on the conference call and these become some of the first things to go into the next slide deck.

Below is the process you will use for you to submit your forms.\nYou will need to first complete the Capstone Purchase Form ( PURCHASE_FORM(Fillable_Form).pdf ) Once you have completed the form and have all the appropriate documents required for your purchase, you will need to submit them to your Project Engineer for approval. Typically this is via the EDN so that the team can discuss the purchase and revise as needed. Your PE may prefer an email with your completed request information. Your Project Engineer will submit your documents to me with his email that he has approved the purchase.\nI will then place your order. When I receive your order from the vendor, I will send you an email stating that your it has arrived. Your order will be either given to your Project Engineer who will deliver it to you or it will be put on your team bench in the fabrication area.\nThe best way to contact me is via email (mastev@rpi.edu). I check my email often so I will get back to you quickly.\nUnlike IED where students pay for all project materials, your Capstone project covers the costs for your project materials.

It is almost always better to embed the Excel or PowerPoint source into the destination document (Word or other PowerPoint presentation). If you paste in an image of the spreadsheet or slide then it cannot be revised unless the original separate spreadsheet or PowerPoint can be found. This often causes challenges for teams as that document has proven to be difficult to find! Sometimes the original was never posted to EDN and is lost. To make a revision the spreadsheet or slide must be recreated from scratch, a great loss of productivity. For spreadsheets, the formulas used may be lost forever.\nIf the original document is embedded then it is possible to simply double click on it.

Often this does not uncover 'obvious' unspoken needs or other aspects not customer focused.\nFollowing list of Requirement Types may inspire team to generate additional needs for the design:\nSome types are closely related. For examples:\nRemember that the gathering of Customer Needs and then converting those into Project Requirements was covered in IED!\nThe attached file atlee-chapter4.pdf is an excerpt from a book on software development. This chapter broadly covers requirements gathering and definitions for software projects.\nRequirements for software packages can be managed using other techniques - Software Requirements Specifications\nAnother powerful tool for gathering requirements is the \"user stories\". There are many resources on this to be found online. Although perhaps developed and widely used in the software development area it can also be applied to other areas.\nIn the simplest form, it consists of documenting who the user is, what they need to be able to do, and what the benefit / reason is.\nIt is often desirable to be able to sort these by the user type/role, so it is recommended that these be kept in a simple spreadsheet like this one - User Stories.xlsx\nUser stories describe functional needs. We write acceptance criteria to add details to user stories to make them more specific and measurable (testable). A user story gets one or more acceptance criteria.\nATTACHMENTS BELOW\n\n",

This allows complete trace-ability of needs and requirements in your documentation as long as you do not change any of the numbering! Instead, simply add new items after the existing ones. Do not insert needs or requirements into the middle of the list. Just add them at the end of the list to keep the numbering intact.\nUse this review form ( Requirements_Check_List.doc ) as a guide line and make sure you did not miss any critical requirements/specifications.\nUseful books and references - the requirements spreadsheet provided in IED can be found here.\nFunctionality\nPerformance (Quality)\nSafety\nAesthetic (Look and Feel)\nUsability\nAccessibility\nReliability, Durability, and Availability\nManufacturability and Material\nTechnical \u2013 Example: The system must be written in Python.\nMaintainability and Support\nCost (Development and Manufacturing)\nEnvironmental impact\nReliability is related to performance (quality).\nRepairability is also related to environmental impact.\nMaterial is related to environmental impact because of recyclability.\nAs a [type of user], I want to [perform some tasks] so that I can [achieve some goals].\nAs a [type of user], I want a [feature] so that I can [satisfy a need].\nAs a student I must regularly post technical contributions to the Electronic Design Notebook so that I can collaborate effectively with my team.\nThe car's transmission must transfer the energy from the engine to the wheels so that the vehicle can move.\nAs a driver I must be able to control the car's energy transfer so that I can go forward and backward.\nAs a driver I must be able to control the car's energy transfer so that I drive slowly and fast both with a boat/trailer attached and without it.\nAs a user, I want a reliable system so that I can use it to complete assigned tasks.\nAcceptance Criterion: The downtime of the system is less than 15 minutes/day.\nAcceptance Criterion: The downtime of the system is less than 15 minutes/day.\nAs a user, I want a secure system so that my data is protected.\nOnly authorized users can access the system.\nWhen a user failed to be authenticated three times, the user account is locked.

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb\nPrototyping may have many meanings during the overall life cycle of a project. Often, \"the prototype\" is the goal for a team in that by the end of the semester they will have completed one or more prototypes of the device / system.\nBut long before that final prototype, multiple intermediate prototypes may be desired or required.\nConsider this example. The team requires a force sensor and must determine whether a particular sensor will properly work in their project's application. It may be required to physically prototype a measurement setup to verify this. This setup might include the sensor, a mount for the sensor, and in the case of a force sensor, some sort of load for the sensor to measure.\nAfter initial testing of this configuration the team may identify modifications to the sensor mount and create a second prototype. Testing using this configuration may suggest that a similar but different sensor would be a better choice. After making the necessary modifications and obtaining the new sensor a third prototype is built and tested. Assuming this configuration works as required it will be incorporated into the overall project prototype.\nThese are all prototypes! But they should not be confused with the project's final prototype(s).\nIn the first case, it is clear that the end result will be a single prototype. The team may however, as shown in the example above, still need to construct many prototypes for testing of various aspects of the project. These may or may not be of value to the sponsor and thus may become deliverable or disposable.\nIn the second case, it should be clear that at the end of the semester the team will be delivering multiple prototypes.

It is supposed to work on Windows and Lunix but Mark Anderson has only used it on Ubuntu. On the Ubuntu platform it was included up to the 12.04 release at which point the Ubuntu team dropped it. The source for the final version (1.1) was still available at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/+source/harpia as of 4/1/2015.\nHarpia is a Python program and provides a GUI for experimenting with image processing. It generates C code that calls OpenCV to do the actual processing.\nAs there is no suitable packaged release, Harpia must be installed and the dependencies resolved manually.\nOn this platform, Mark Anderson was able to perform an installation with these steps. The package is NOT tested / verified in this environment and may still not work completely / correctly.\nAt this point, Harpia can be launched using the command 'harpia'. The GUI should open. The installation can be verified by trying the examples ( on the menu, Help -> Examples).\nIt is optimistic but untested that following the Ubuntu 12.04 steps will work on 14.04 with the same assumptions in place.\nChanges to OpenCV may cause the compiling / linking operations to change over time. In fact the only changes from version 1 to 1.1 were adjustments to the Makefile that harpia generates. Python 3 may potentially require many changes and are not addressed here.\n\n",

        "content": "Knowledge Base \u00bb EDN FAQ \u00bb\nThis page provides information and guidelines for project management and creating / using EDN's built in Gantt Chart features.\nFor Capstone, we are not expecting that all of our students will eventually become project managers! We do expect, however, that many students will work within a project oriented job setting or that a future job setting might benefit from adopting project management techniques.\nThe resources below are intended primarily to expose you to the benefits and the language & terminology used in project management.\nThere are many articles on this topic - some for training purposes to help people become project managers or to further develop their skills, some to help explain why a company should have or employ project managers and some that are introductory.\nThe selection of resources listed here are intended only to help explain why applying project management is important.\nThere is no shortage of videos on project management. Some focus on the career path of a project manager, some focus on justifying why one is need and there are many tutorials and on-line courses about project management that are intended to help individuals learn these skills.\nThe video(s) below are intended to help you understand why project management is important and why we feel that students should develop some basic project management skills.\nThe purpose of the Gantt chart is to facilitate a successful project. It is to help team members communicate among themselves to their project sponsors/mentors and to their Chief and Project Engineers. It is NOT a homework assignment to be done and forgotten! It IS a living document that must be updated and maintained regularly, adding new items as they are identified and updating the status of existing items. It will show who is the owner of each task and when it is due / available so that others can plan their own work.\nIt is a tool for teams to help hold team members accountable for their work - in terms of quantity, timeliness and quality.\nOne of the first steps to project planning is to create a Work Breakdown Structure. This document Sample_WBS_by_Task_Types.pptx will show a sample WBS. We recommend that you do a brief web search for other examples and more information.\nThese are the major deliverables of your project. EDN calls these \"Versions\". Be sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these! Milestones are reached by achieving a series of tasks (see below). Milestones represent an all or nothing measurement. Either your team has reached the milestone or they have not!\nThis website has some helpful information on understanding what makes a milestone: https://www.ittoolkit.com/how-to-it/projects/project-milestones.html\nThese are the steps you must take to get from one milestone to another. Each task represents a measurable chunk of work. As a result, a team can measure it's progress toward a milestone by examining the individual tasks required to get there. EDN calls these 'Issues' and will automatically calculate the percentage of issues completed to reach a given milestone.\nBe sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these!\nThis file can be printed on 11x17 paper. It has rows for each team member's name and columns for several weeks. Each team member can then fill in what they plan to do for each week to contribute to the project. This can then be team reviewed and used to identify planning gaps and or overlap - Fill_In_Gantt_Chart-v4.xlsx.\nThe Project Management Institute has a large amount of information on their web site: https://pmiteach.org/\nAttachments Below\n\n",
