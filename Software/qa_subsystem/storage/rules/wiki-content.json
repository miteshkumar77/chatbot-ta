These generally use the sponsor's online conferencing tool and conference call dial in number. Teams can obtain a free Webex account that will (currently) provide up to 3 connections on a given conference. For these, we will use the Design Lab's conference phone number.\n\tTeams - It is YOUR responsibility to schedule all your calls / visits, not your Project Engineer's. Have your Project Engineer make the entries to this list for your calls.\n\tProject Engineers - Please add EACH call or visit separately. Please keep the list sorted by date and add a blank line between months to help keep it organized.\n\t\nInstructions for Making Webex Based Conference Meetings\n\tUse the \"Schedule\" button within your Webex team space to bring up Outlook. Add your sponsor(s) names/emails to get your meetings on their calendar. Note that this method REQUIRES Outlook - check within your team to see who has it installed.\n\tPlan B - determine your meeting info, then send that to your sponsor through some other means - BUT - that will not place you on their calendar, meaning you could run into a schedule issue. Please ask your sponsor to manually add it to their calendar as they probably are not used to doing this within their company.\n\t\nInstructions for Making Conference Calls\n\t\n\tThis document provides the instructions for using the conference phone bridge ( Telephone_Conference_Procedures_for_Participants.docx ). You can email your sponsor a copy of this. Your Project Engineer or Chief Engineer can initiate the call for you with their moderator passcode.\n\t\n\t\n\tThis page has How to Hold a Conference Call. The information also applies to in person sponsor visits. It can be used as a checklist to ensure that the meeting goes smoothly.\n\t\n\t\n\tIn general, use a PowerPoint presentation to guide the conference call/visit as both are meetings. Information on making a strong set of slides can be found on the Creating Strong PowerPoint Presentations page.\n\t\n\t\nTelephone Numbers\n\tThe numbers for the phone jacks in the Design Lab are: back table: (518) 276-8758, east (ramp) side: - x8757, west (stair) side - x2499, Project Engineer's office (JEC2027) - x2733.\n\tFor the east & west locations you need to get the portable speaker phone. The portable speakerphone is normally in Junichi's office in the lab.\n\t\nScheduled Calls and Sponsor Visits\n\tThis link provides access to the scheduled calls. Contact your Project Engineer to be added to the list.\n\t\nScheduled Calls - Previous Semester these have been saved to help cut&paste and to help remember when we had previously held the calls with each sponsor.\n\t\nVisitor Parking\n\tSponsors can park in the Visitor's Parking Lot (the lot between the Union and the Armory) on 15th Street. Students should see Valerie to get a parking pass and arrange to meet the visitor at the parking area to give them the pass. Valerie Masterson can be reach at (518) 276-2724.\n\tDirections and map ( Directions RPI Design Lab.pdf )campus map  http://rpi.edu/tour/rpi_campus_map_2010.pdfAnnotated map with parking and JEC ( campus map_edited.jpg )---\n\tAttachments Below\n  Files (3)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Telephone_Conference_Procedures_for_Participants.docx    (29.7 KB)\n    Telephone_Conference_Procedures_for_Participants.docx  \n  Conference call instructions for participants\n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2010-09-13 10:08 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Directions RPI Design Lab.pdf    (402 KB)\n    Directions RPI Design Lab.pdf  \n  \n  \n      Scott Miller (RPI), 2017-07-31 11:24 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    campus map_edited.jpg    (306 KB)\n    campus map_edited.jpg  \n  \n  \n      Scott Miller (RPI), 2017-08-02 03:17 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/How_to_Hold_a_Conference_Call": "\nHow to Hold a Conference Call - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nSponsor Calls and Visits  \n  Table of contentsHow to Hold a Conference Call / Sponsor VisitConference Call power point slidesTimeline for PreparingChecklist for the Visit / Conference Call 'Process':Checklist for Using WebexChecklist for Using a WebcamChecklist for Including a Demo\nHow NOT to Hold a Conference CallKey Dont's / Things to Avoid\n\t\nHow to Hold a Conference Call / Sponsor Visit\n\tThis page represents The Design Lab's 'best practices' when holding conference calls and hosting sponsor visits.

We want to make sure you have the supporting information to back up your statements.You are to use verbal communication to clarify, answer questions, guide participant attention - DO NOT USE verbal to fill in technical content not on the slides.\n\t\nTimeline for Preparing\nEnsure that the team has time to prepare and revise the material, that the Project Engineer has a chance to review and provide feedback and that the sponsor receives the information early enough to have time to review it and prepare for the call.\n\t\n\tTwo classes before the conference call the team should have (on EDN) a fairly complete slide set with the outline for the meeting.\n\t\n\tInclude material \"left over\" from the previous call\n\t\tInclude slides to remind you to include updates in work still in process\n\t\tWill understandably NOT be a complete slide set yet\n\t\tYour Project Engineer will provide feedback on the outline and preliminary content for you to address BEFORE your next class\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOne class before the conference call the team should have (on EDN) the final slide deck (by the start of class so that feedback can be provided during class)\n\t\n\tAll content should now be present - everything you want the sponsor to know MUST be on the slides.\n\t\tYour status update should be current\n\t\tYour Project Engineer will provide feedback for you to address BEFORE you can send out the email to your sponsor with a link to your slide deck.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSend slide deck one business day ahead of call (ex: if the call is at 1 PM Friday then one business day is 1 PM Thursday, NOT 3 AM Friday)\n\t\n\tIt is understood that there are last minute developments however we generally do NOT update and resend the slides. We mention these on the conference call and these become some of the first things to go into the next slide deck. Once you establish this rhythm, the slide sets become straightforward to create.\n\t\nChecklist for the Visit / Conference Call 'Process':\n\tNote that some items, such as conference call number, do not apply to in-person visits.\n\t\n\tHave the number to call in front of you ahead of the call.\n\t\tKnow how to dial out on the phone you are using. It may be different than you expect!\n\t\tKnow HOW you are conducting the call! Are you:\n\t\n\tCalling a specific number at the sponsor?\n\t\tUsing the RPI conference call bridge?\n\t\tUsing the sponsor's conference call bridge.\n\t\tUsing your Project Engineer's or a student's Webex?\n\t\tUsing the Sponsor's Webex/Skype/Microsoft Teams?\n\t\tUsing a webcam or not?\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHave practiced actually using Webex (or other conference tool) BEFORE the day of the call. Do NOT learn how to use it just before the call starts. It delays the call and makes a poor impression.\n\t\tHave an official note taker and facilitator.\n\t\tEVERYONE should take notes, not just the official note taker. You might catch something that the note taker missed.\n\t\tWhen someone asks questions about a slide it means the slide could have been clearer. Make note of the questions as they provide you with valuable feedback on how to improve your next slide deck. Questions also indicate hot topics of interest to the Sponsor - again good to know so that you can include info in your next slide deck.\n\t\n\t\nChecklist for Using Webex\n\t\n\tIdentify which PC will be hosting the Webex well before the call.\n\t\n\tThere is a small software download required for Webex. Do this in advance!\n\t\tEnsure that Webex actually works on that PC! There have been issues!\n\t\tIf the Webex PC is running Ubuntu, there have been issues. It appears that loading the Oracle version of Java may solve this. To reduce risk, simply use a Windows or Mac instead. Figure out the Ubuntu/Webex issues at some other time or long before the call!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEnsure that the presenter already has the file loaded before the call starts.\n\t\tWhen possible, do a practice session with your Project Engineer at least a day before the meeting.\n\t\tBe sure you know which screen you are sharing. Usually, when PowerPoint jumps into \"Presenter Mode\" that is the screen that get's shared, NOT the one showing a full screen image of your slide as expected. Either choose the proper monitor OR disable Presenter Mode OR force your laptop into Duplicate Screen mode instead of extended screen mode.\n\t\n\t\nChecklist for Using a Webcam\n\t\n\tPick at least two students' laptops and during the class meeting before the day of the call.\n\t\tConnect the webcam to both PC's.\n\t\tDownload/install drivers if required.\n\t\tMake sure the camera works in WebEx.\n\t\n\t\nChecklist for Including a Demo\n\t\n\tDry run the demo with your Project Engineer no later than the class before the day you will be giving the demo. This gives you time to make minor improvements or repairs/adjustments.\n\t\n\t\nHow NOT to Hold a Conference Call\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYu_bGbZiiQ\n\tAlthough this is very entertaining, those of us with experience have actually seen many of these things happen on real calls. Unfortunately, sometimes in Capstone!\n\t\nKey Dont's / Things to Avoid\n\t\n\tDon't send out revised slides at the start of the call! \n\t\n\tIt causes confusion.\n\t\tOn the call mention that there are last minute results but the material will be in the next set of slides.\n\t\tBe sure that the next call will have an update!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDo NOT surprise your Chief or Project Engineers.\n\t\n\tAlert them before the call of any last minute issues, problems, discoveries.\n\t\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Meetings": "\nMeetings - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  \n  \nMeetings\n\tIneffective meetings waste time.

One is located in the Design Lab in the back corner of the room at the conference table. A second phone is available from the staff and may be used in one of the other phone jacks in the lab or the Project Engineer's office.\n\tPhone Call Procedures details how to place local and long distance calls from the Polycom conference phone through RPI's phone system.\n\tFurther information (specifically regarding the use of RPI's phone system) can be found here: http://helpdesk.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=553\n\tFull manuals for the actual phone and external microphones are attached for convenience.  They were downloaded from Polycom's website, here: http://www.polycom.com/support/voice/soundstation/soundstation.html\n\tAlso please read Teleconferencing Etiquette BEFORE your first conference call! Plan ahead!\n\t\nElectronic & Other Equipment -- scopes, power supplies, meters, waveform generators\n\tWe now manage our available textbooks, electronics and other equipment through the [[Booty Bay]] module here in EDN. You can work with your Project Engineer to reserve a book or equipment for your project. The item will be assigned to a team member who is then responsible for returning the item as the end of the semester.\nWe have the following manuals for the electronics equipment located on the benches in the shop:\n\t\n\tDC Power Supply (Agilent) - DC-PS_Agilent.pdf \n\t\tDigital Multimeter (Agilent) - DMM_Agilent.pdf \n\t\tOscilloscope (Agilent) - Scope_Agilent.pdf\n\t\n\t\nHow do I access to the MDL Fabrication Area outside the normal open hours? (8am-5pm M-F)\n\tThe After Hours Policy is found elsewhere in the wiki. You must follow the after hour policy and get an approval from the Manager of Fabrication & Prototyping at least 48 hours in advance.\n\t\nHow can I print while I am in the Lab?\n\tUse the public printer EC3232LW in the lab.

Design documentation may include CAD drawings and bills of materials, technical design reports and presentation review notes, engineering analysis models and calculations, product test data, engineering specifications, and much more.\n\t\nWhat makes a technical post\nIn the Design Lab, you are required to maintain a record of your contributions to the project by posting messages to your team's Electronic Design Notebook (EDN). Your project evaluators (PE and CE) will periodically read your messages to help understand your thoughts and design decisions, and will ultimately use it to help determine your final grade.  Your student team mates will read your messages to collectively move the project forwards. Your messages can be a valuable resource for preparing individual and team deliverables and helping you to remember important design information and to maintain personal organization.  The system automatically maintains a chronological organization of your records. You should include the following types of information and post at least two messages every week:\n\t\n\tBackground Information:  The original problem statement and objectives, team organization, meeting notes, customer requirements, functional analysis, research on prior art, competitor benchmarking, critical engineering parameters, references to other peoples work, project plans.  \n\t\tSystem Design Concepts: Alternative ideas that were considered, sketches, flowcharts, system diagrams, figures, diagrams, descriptions of hardware and software, pictures of prototypes and descriptions of how design elements were integrated. \n\t\tEngineering Analysis and Calculations: Design objectives for critical parameters, possible interactions with other parameters, assumptions, mathematical models and formulas with references to their sources, parameter values used with units of measure, design constraints and trade-offs.\n\t\tTest Data and Results:  Test objectives, process descriptions, experimental plans and set-up, potential noise factors, input and output parameters, data and analysis, and observations.  \n\t\tContacts: The name, contact information, and brief description of each external resource used, such as suppliers of specialized parts, service providers, and experts.\n\t\n\tAs all teams will use Subversion, checking in a design document to Subversion counts as posting a message. Please remember to also post a message to the forum indicating that new information is available at the Subversion. The forum is the place to discuss the information you placed in Subversion.\n\tWithin the EDN, we comment on each others work to collaborate for the purpose of improving the overall technical team output and the communication of that output. This is a work skill, part of your professional development, and is not limited to Capstone.\nWhen providing constructive feedback to each other's postings, whether here or anywhere else on the EDN, please consider the following:\n\t\n\tHow will your comment(s) help the author improve the quality of their work?\n\t\tIs their posting clear to you? If not, help them by explaining which aspects were not clear.\n\t\tWould the posting be clear to others on the team? If not, help them by explaining which aspects were not clear.\n\t\tDid their posting help increase your personal knowledge? How so? If not, help them understand how their posting could have done that.\n\t\tIs there additional information that would make things better / clearer / more useful / etc.? If so, provide that feedback with your suggestions as to how that could be accomplished.\n\t\tIs the posting well organized, divided into appropriate sections making it easy to read and understand? If not, again, provide suggestions on how to improve it.\n\t\tIf references / citations are appropriate, are they provided in the proper / useful format? \n\t\tIs the material well supported by facts rather than representing only opinions? While opinions certainly matter, from an engineering perspective, they usually carry less weight than fact based information.\n\t\nIn general, feedback like the following is not nearly as helpful:\n\t\n\tgood job\n\t\tnicely formatted except for a few missing spaces / some punctuation / some headers\n\t\tlooks great\n\t\tanything not directly relating to the technical content\n\t\n\tThese would be in addition to the usual guidance on maintaining professional behavior, providing constructive comments, etc.\n\tIn the course of the design development process, individual engineers will also maintain records of the many design decisions made along the way with background, insights, and thoughts that they may have had.  To maintain personal organization, many engineers will use a design notebook to record a log of meeting notes, system concept sketches, critical design parameters, engineering calculations, flow diagrams, system schematics, and any references that serve as a reminder of how and when they arrived at their design decisions. A well-organized design notebook provides an evolutionary depiction of the design development process and can serve as an official record of exactly when and how ideas may have been developed in support of potential patent claims.  The EDN website will serve as your personal, and the team's collective, design notebook.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Meeting_Minutes": "\nMeeting Minutes - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Meetings  \n  \nMeeting Minutes\n\tEach team is responsible to post the minutes of a meeting to EDN, typically in the Project Management forum for their project. This provides a record of the decision making processes used during the project. Meeting minutes allow missing members of your team to stay up to date. This includes your Sponsor/Mentor, Project Engineer and Chief Engineer!\n\tThis task should rotate among the team members, to ensure every student generates at least one memo.  These minutes should summarize important activities and progress during the course of the semester and include a list of weekly assigned tasks, responsibilities for completing tasks, and estimated time and resources for completion.  The team should maintain an updated list of action items as a regular component of the minutes of a meeting.  It should highlight any issues that the team is facing and corresponding actions that the team is taking to solve problems. Submit the minutes of a meeting as a message in Project Management forum and avoid attaching a Word file because attachments are not searchable in the EDN.\n\tThere are MANY resources on the web for taking good meeting minutes - a fast search will yield many! In particular, look at the templates offered by Microsoft Word and/or Open Office - but do not take your minutes in these tools. Use a simple plain text editor instead.\nIn general the meeting minutes should record:\n\t\n\tDate/time of the meeting\n\t\twho took the minutes\n\t\twho is present, who was missing\n\t\n\tIf no one missed the meeting, state the fact, i.e. None.\n\t\tdocument late arrivals and early departures as needed \n\t\n\t\n\t\tthe agenda items that were discussed / key discussion points\n\t\tresults of the discussions, ex: decisions reached\n\t\taction items including (who / what / when):\n\t\n\tdescription of the item\n\t\twho owns the item / who will do the item\n\t\tthe due date for the item / when it will be available to the team\n\t\tif no action item was identified, document the fact, i.e. \"No action item was identified.\"\n\t\n\t\n\tEDN's issues tool provides an excellent method for recording these action items. Simply use the \"To Do\" category and if all the fields are filled in you will have an accurate record of the who / what / when aspects for each! You can then track progress of these on EDN by simply updating the status regularly.\n\tDO NOT take your minutes in Word/Open Office and then attach a \"doc\" file. It is MUCH easier on the reader to see the information directly in the posting rather than having to open a document to get it. Even worse is to paste the text into the posting AND still attach the same thing as a \"DOC\" file! Now the reader has to open the attachment only to find that it's the same as the text in the posting.  Posting as plain text also allows easy searching for information using EDN's search functionality.\n\tDO post a picture or a photo of your whiteboard as an attachment.\n\tA simple template has been created - export:template documents/Meeting Minutes.txt\n\tThis is a text file that you can edit for your meeting minutes. Please do not use word processing tools such as Word as they will introduce formatting problems. Please do NOT attach the file! Instead, copy & paste  the text directly into the EDN comment box for proper formatting.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/EDN_FAQ": "\nEDN FAQ - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  \n  Table of contentsEDN FAQIntroduction to our EDN: Electronic_Design_Notebook.pptxShort Highlights of EDN usage: Electronic Design Notebook TL;DR.pptxQuick Start Guide: Using the Electronic Design Notebook for Capstone Design.pptxEDN for Sponsors / Mentors: EDN_for_sponsors.docxBasic How To GuidesUseful EDN tricksCommon problems students encounter, and how to solve themUsing Gantt Charts / Project ManagementWhere do I \"put\" information?The WikiIssuesVersions (Releases or Milestones)The ForumsPosting GuidelinesBackground InfoProject ManagementDesignStatement of WorkMidtermFinal Deliverables\n\t\nEDN FAQ\n\t\nIntroduction to our EDN: Electronic_Design_Notebook.pptx\n\t\nShort Highlights of EDN usage: Electronic Design Notebook TL;DR.pptx\n\tThis is a very short intro to using the EDN.

They are:\n\t\n\tthe Wiki\n\t\tthe Issues\n\t\tReleases / Versions\n\t\tthe Forums\n\t\n\tThese tools are typically provided for all projects - please ask your Project Engineer or the system manager if they are not currently available for your project!\n\t\nThe Wiki\n\tThe Wiki for a project serves as it's knowledge base - much as this wiki serves as a knowledge base for the entire Capstone program. In the wiki teams can collaboratively gather information related to the project such as instructions, guidelines, techniques, processes, test plans, etc.\n\tWe have an example of a Typical Home Page along with more suggestions and ideas.\n\t\nIssues\n\tIssues are used to manage things that \"come and go\" during a project, such as tasks, design errors, and implementation errors (aka \"bugs\" for the software folks). Use an issue every time a problem is identified, an error is detected, or a key piece of information had been identified as missing. Then, assign the issue to a team member who is then responsible for updating the issue as progress is made. When the issue is complete it's status is changed to reflect that and the % done is automatically updated to 100%. Using the EDN tools a user can see the list of open issues and with the filters, look for those that belong to a particular person.\n\tBecause the EDN includes an automatic Gantt chart feature, issues are even more important as every issue is automatically available on the project's Gantt chart. It is recommended that a specific category be used to flag issues that are intended to be seen on the Gantt chart and that using the filters, the other issues are not viewed.\n\tNOTE - Issues will not show up on the Gantt chart unless you enter a due date!\n\tYou can indicate relationships between issues in EDN. You can indicate that issue A \"precedes\" issue B, meaning that A must be completed before B. This also means that you should close the issues in that order.\n\tWhen closing an issue it is important to ensure that the body of issue includes a link to the location of the artifact/outputs related to the issue. This could be a repository revision number (denoted by lower case r then the revision number ex: r115), forum posting (denoted by message#12345), or a specific wiki page. Someone other than the assignee should be responsible for verifying the completeness and accuracy of the artifact/outputs before closing.\n\t\nVersions (Releases or Milestones)\n\tOn the Gantt chart, these form the milestones used in project management. Issues should be tied to a \"Version\" which will properly group them on the Gantt chart.\n\t\nThe Forums\n\tThe Forums, sometimes called \"Discussion Boards\", provide a place for teams to discuss the various aspects of the project. To facilitate this, a standard set of boards are created for each project. These are described in the next few sections. In general the forums are used to provide a collaborative platform for our teams. Students as well as sponsor / mentors, faculty and staff are all users of these forums. They are often used to help create a dialog among these members of the team.\n\tForum postings cannot be \"moved\" or deleted by students.\n\tTo \"end\" a thread that should continue elsewhere, simply add a \"last\" posting that indicates that the thread has ended and give the reader an indication of where to look, ex: in the Design forum, posting titled \"Topic X\". Best practice would provide a link to the new/current location of the discussion.\n\t\nPosting Guidelines\nThere are a number of best practices for posting.\n\t\n\tNote that attachments cannot be searched! Rather than post an attachment of text, please just post that text directly. \n\t\tWhen attaching a file, ALWAYS post the ORIGINAL file, meaning the actual file you were editing to produce it. For Word this is the DOC/DOCX file, for PowerPoint, the PPT/PPTX file. For CAD programs, post the CAD file itself. This allows people to open the original file and make changes if needed.\n\t\tIf the program that you were using is not part of Microsoft Office / OpenOffice, post a PDF as well. This allows people who don't have the program to still see your results.\n\t\tDO NOT USE MICROSOFT PAINT or similar drawing program to generate diagrams. Engineers use \"real\" graphics programs like CAD or PowerPoint. We do NOT use Photoshop to create drawings nor Publisher to create posters.\n\t\n\t\nBackground Info\n\tThe one - two page project description should be posted in this section.Introductory files from the sponsor can be posted here.\n\t\nProject Management\n\tStudents use this forum to post their contact and availability information and to coordinate team meetings held outside of class time. Status reports and minutes from all meetings should be posted here as well.\n\t\nDesign\n\tThis forum acts as part of the team's electronic design notebook. As technical information is obtained and analyzed, it should be posted here. Team members are responsible for periodically reviewing the materials and offering insightful and constructive comments. Faculty, staff, and your sponsor/mentors will do the same!\n\t\nStatement of Work\n\tOnce the problem statement is partially understood, the team works toward creating Statement of Work (SoW, Phase 1 of the Design Report). Team members use this forum to post drafts of the SoW for collaborative editing and feedback. Once a version of the SoW is accepted by the Project Engineer and Chief Engineer a \"final\" version should be posted. As changes to the SoW are negotiated over the balance of the semester, those versions should be posted as well.\n\t\nMidterm\n\tThis forum is for team use when collaborating on the midterm deliverables - Poster for PDR, Preliminary Design Review PPT, & Preliminary Design Document (Phase 2 of Design Report). Drafts should be posted for review and feedback.\n\t\nFinal Deliverables\n\tThis forum is for team use when collaborating on the end of term deliverables - Poster, Final Design Review PPT, and Phase 3 of Design Report. Drafts should be posted for review and feedback.\n\tAttachments Below\n  Files (4)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Electronic_Design_Notebook.pptx    (131 KB)\n    Electronic_Design_Notebook.pptx  \n  5 min Introduction\n  \n      Junichi Kanai, 2018-01-19 08:04 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Electronic Design Notebook TL;DR.pptx    (366 KB)\n    Electronic Design Notebook TL;DR.pptx  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2018-08-13 09:45 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    EDN_for_sponsors.docx    (19.3 KB)\n    EDN_for_sponsors.docx  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2019-01-09 03:08 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Using the Electronic Design Notebook for Capstone Design.pptx    (2.3 MB)\n    Using the Electronic Design Notebook for Capstone Design.pptx  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2021-07-01 09:25 AM\n  \n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Creating_a_New_Forum_Thread": "\nCreating a New Forum Thread - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  \n  \nCreating a New Forum Thread\n\t\nHow do I post a new message in the forums?\n\t\n\tSelect one of the existing forums. \n\t\tUse the \"New Message\" link in the upper right corner to create a new posting.\n\t\n\t\nHow do I create a new top level thread?\n\t\n\tYou DON'T.\n\t\n\tWhatever information you're trying to post most likely belongs in one of the existing 5 top level forums.

These are stored in a 'repository' on the same server as the Electronic Design Notebook system. All project work for a given semester is to be done in the 'working' folder (see below). At the end of the semester, each team is to create a project archive or 'tag' (see below). This tag is a snapshot of the semester's work and allows future teams to see the exact project status at the end of each previous semester.\n\t\nBasic How To Guides\n\t\n\tGetting Started with Subversion-For Windows Users (includes installation): \n\t\n\tPowerPoint: capstone-support-dev:export:training\\Getting Started with Subversion-For Windows Users.pptx \n\t\tVideo (10 min): capstone-support-dev:export:training\\Getting Started with Subversion-For Windows Users.mp4 \n\t\n\t\n\t\tFor Mac Users: we do NOT have a separate video at this time. Please watch the one for Windows. You will use svn-x as the client. If you are comfortable with terminal and the UNIX command line, you may use the svn command line client. Please visit the Subversion Clients page for instructions.\n\t\tFor Linux Users: we do NOT have a separate video at this time. Please watch the one for Windows. On Ubuntu, you may use RabbitVCS as the client. If you are comfortable with the command line, you may use the svn command line client. Please visit the Subversion Clients page for instructions.\n\t\n\t\n\tIan Keyworth, one of our students, took the available materials and generated a short quick start guide. Subversion_Quick_Start_Guide_for_Dummies.docx Note that the guide covers \n\t\n\tchecking out things from Subversion\n\t\tinitially creating a repository / repository structure.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tFor guidance on what goes where in the repository, see the sections below OR watch this video (5 min): capstone-support-dev:export:training\\Using the Repository - What Goes Where and When.mp4\n\t\n\t\n\tMuch more documentation is available on the Subversion website: http://tortoisesvn.net/support\n\t\n\t\n\tJunichi Kanai put together this short instruction on using Tortoise to obtain usage statistics on Subversion to help monitor team progress and activity - Using_TortiseSVN_for_Evaluation.pptx\n\t\n\t\n\tEnd of semester Archiving (also called tagging)\n\t\n\t\nCommon problems students encounter, and how to solve them:\n\tHow should I interact with files in SVN? - Install a Subversion Client I can't commit a fileHow to run Cleanup?Our team wants to use Git instead of SVNHow to EASILY access newest version of Capstone Playbook\n\t\nSubversion / Tortoise / SvnX complains about a security certificate\nIf your subversion client complains about a security issue, you will have to first install the subversion client (see Install a Subversion Client) then run the following command in the terminal window using YOUR project's project-identifier. Note that \"svn\" is the command for running Subversion.\n\t\n\tsvn info https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/svn2/project-identifier \n\t\twhen prompted, accept the security certificate \"p\" for permanently.\n\t\tThen svnX should be able to access your repository.\n\t\n\t\nSubversion Clients\n\tInteracting with your project's Repository through a browser is possible, but cumbersome. We strongly recommend installing a Subversion Client to allow smoother file use.\n\t\nRepositories / Repository\n\t\nRepository Contents\nExamples of information that should be in the project's working folder on the repository are:\n\t\n\tDesign Documents  CAD database and drawings, circuit diagrams, system block diagrams and engineering specifications\n\t\tSystem Evaluation  Test procedures, test results including raw data, and software used to analyze the results \n\t\tReports, and presentations in addition to the final output  Each phase of the Design Report (SoW, PDD, Final), preliminary and final presentation, preliminary and final poster\n\t\tNeeds & Requirements workbook  A list of needs, customer requirements, and related material, such as use cases.\n\t\tDesign Analysis  Simulation software and results\n\t\tPrototype System (Components) - Software (source code) and a user manual\n\t\n\tTagging creates an end of semester archive of your repository.\n\tIt is CRITICAL to remember that there should also be threads created in the Forum to document the reasoning and discussion about files in the Repository. This will help explain to teammates, sponsor, and instructors WHY a CAD model looks like it does, or WHAT additional work is needed on a spreadsheet calculation.\n\t\nNaming / Location\n\tAll our repositories are managed by EDN and can be found at: https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/svn2/repo-name/working where repo-name is the name of your repository.\n\tWith EDN, repositories are automatically created when new projects are defined. The name of your repository is the same as the project's identifier. To determine the project identifier, simply look at the URL for your project. For THIS project, the URL is: https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/working and \"capstone-support-dev\" is the identifier. If it had one, this project's working repository would be found at: https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/svn2/capstone-support-dev/working\n\tFor security control, your EDN username and password are used to access the repository for your project.\n\t\nRepository Folder Structure\nThere is a generally accepted convention for the folder structure. For the Design Lab, repositories will have two top level folders:\n\t\n\tTags - where archives are created by the Project Engineer after the end of each semester\n\t\tWorking - where the current semester's work takes place\n\t\n\tThis initial folder structure is created by your Project Engineer at the start of a project. Future teams will then use that existing folder structure.\n\t\nThe Working Folder\n\tThe concept of a \"working\" folder is that it is there for the entire life of a project. Whether the current team happens to need every file or not. It does NOT represent the currently semester's \"working\" folder. Some things that are clearly historical only, like background memos can be deleted after they are 'tagged'. Other things like the posters and reports are simply overwritten each semester with the latest and greatest since they too have already been tagged.\n\tWorking Folder Structure\n\tMany of our projects run across multiple semesters with each new team broadly continuing the work of the previous team. Our projects in EDN are thus set up to support this. They are NOT set up on a semester by semester basis. The working folder will be where all of the project's (from all the semesters) active work will be saved. Your working folder is part of the technology transfer for your project.\n\tPLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLDER STRUCTURE!\n\tWithin the working folder we use a \"functionally\" oriented folder structure:\n    tags\n    working\n       Background Information\n       CAD (mechanical & electrical)\n       Data\n       Engineering Analysis\n       Purchasing\n       Reports\n          Design Report + Poster\n          Status Reports\n       Software\n\t\nThe Tags Folder\n\tThe Tag folder is used to create \"snapshots\" of a project. Projects are tagged by the Project Engineer ONLY at the end of each semester after a thorough review. Students should NOT do the tagging.\n\t\nRepository Usage Guidelines\n\t\n\tAll mechanical CAD models and drawings AND all electrical CAD (i.e. schematics) go to the CAD folder.\n\t\tPurchasing folder\n\t\n\tpurchasing forms - scans or electronic version\n\t\tBill of Materials\n\t\n\t\n\t\tVideo Files\n\t\n\tPlease check with your PE BEFORE you place large video files on the repo.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSoftware folders\n\t\n\tinclude all source code and make files or instructions on how to rebuild the program\n\t\tFor micro-controller types of programming be sure to include full instructions on how to obtain / load their development environment.\n\t\tDo NOT commit virtual machine (VM) images! They are huge! Instead, fully describe how you built it in your project's wiki. Then future teams can rebuild it as needed. All of the key content (source code, data, etc.) on that VM should be coming from your repository.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDO include all documents in their source format not just a PDF of the output, ex: Solidworks / NX CAD models, Photoshop PSD files, etc. Future team(s) may want to reuse your information and/or edit it.\n\t\tDo NOT zip/tar/7z/compress folders into the repository! It should reflect what you are actually working with (you're probably NOT working with zip files) and you do NOT really need to save space in the repository. By avoiding compressed files, others can simply checkout the desired folders and begin working on their contents.\n\t\tFor each directory, you should prepare a README file and include information to help future users utilize the stored files. See below.\n\t\tDo NOT embed version information into folder or file names. For example have a folder called \"Final\". Do NOT have a folder called \"Final - Spring 2011\".\n\t\tFor teams that are using an existing Repository (from a previous semester's team(s) - review the current contents! They are there as your starting point.\n\t\n\tDo not rename their folders or files with a semester name (see above!). Instead, use the existing folders. \n\t\tDO NOT just delete things! Talk to your PE!\n\t\n\tThe PDR & final report/poster will be called the same as what the previous team called it. Yours will then simply replace theirs. Please do not use a different name.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDO NOT name folders after the names of your team mates! Instead, be sure to use functional names. For example rather than calling a folder \"Fred\" because he happened to work on the CAD for a robot arm, call the folder \"Robot Arm\". Team members may work on more than one functional area - so naming the folders by person does not make any sense.\n\t\tAt the end of the semester, be sure to 'clean up' your Reports folder so that only your final version of the Statement of Work, Poster, and Design Report are there. Remove any drafts, temporary files, individual sections, commented copies, etc.\n\t\n\tIf in doubt, please ask your Project Engineer BEFORE you make organizational changes to an existing repo. If you are not absolutely sure about how to proceed, ASK your Project Engineer before you make any changes!\n\tConsult your faculty advisors on archiving any proprietary information obtained from the project sponsor.\n\t\nREADME Files\n\tEvery folder should include a README file to help explain to the contents.\n\tAttachments Below\n  Files (3)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Using_TortiseSVN_for_Evaluation.pptx    (446 KB)\n    Using_TortiseSVN_for_Evaluation.pptx  \n  Using Tortoise / SVN for evaluation (PowerPoint)\n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2010-09-10 12:18 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Subversion_Quick_Start_Guide_for_Dummies.docx    (308 KB)\n    Subversion_Quick_Start_Guide_for_Dummies.docx  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2018-08-13 04:19 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    capstone_folder_tree.zip    (2.26 KB)\n    capstone_folder_tree.zip  \n  folder structure only\n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2020-09-02 04:00 PM\n  \n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Subversion_Clients": "\nSubversion Clients - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Subversion  \n  \nSubversion Clients\n\tThere are a number of free clients available for working with SVN repositories.\n\tYou can view and download the contents of your repository here within EDN by clicking on the 'Repository' link. It is cumbersome to download or view individual files, so Design Lab recommends 'checking out' a copy of your Repository onto your computer.To put files into the repository, you will need a client.\n\t\nWindows\n\tThe recommended client for Windows is Tortoise, downloads and information can be found at: https://tortoisesvn.net/. Be sure to install the right version, the 32bit version will NOT run on a 64 bit Windows system.\n\tAnother tool called \"Commit Monitor\" is also available from the Tortoise site. It lets you monitor your repository for commits made by your team.\n\tIf you want to use the svn commands rather than the GUI, you must choose \"command line client tools\" when TortoiseSVN is installed.  For more information, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2341134/command-line-svn-for-windows\n\t\nMacOS\n\t\nsvnx\n\tFor MAC OS X, UNTIL the Monterey version, students have successfully used svnx which is an open source software tool. Unfortunately, we have not been able to get svnx to work on the Monterey release (12.0) of the Mac OS.\n\tInstructions for downloading and using svnx can be found here.\n\t\nSmartSVN\n\tAn alternative for users with the Monterey release of the Mac OS is to use the free version of SmartSVN (https://www.smartsvn.com/). Please note that we have no experience nor training material for this. Your PE or team mates can help if you are having trouble working out the proper URL for your team's repo.\n\t\nCommand line\n\tThe fallback is to install the command line subversion utility. A very limited set of commands are needed.\n\tThese steps are to be done ONCE in your terminal window:\n\t\n\tDetermine which folder on your Mac is where you want to place your repository.\n\t\tUse the cd command to move to that folder\n\t\tUse the following command to do the checkout. Note the period at the end is required.\n\t\tsvn checkout https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/scn2/&lt;your project identifier>/working .\n\t\tWait till that finishes. The repo is now on your Mac and can be accessed via finder.\n\t\nBefore every time you plan to work on any files in the repo or before adding new ones:\n\t\n\tUse the cd command to move to that folder\n\t\tUse the following command to do the update. \n\t\tsvn update\n\t\tWait till that finishes. The repo is now updated on your Mac and can be accessed via finder.\n\t\nAfter you have made any modifications or added any files:\n\t\n\tUse the cd command to move to that folder\n\t\tUse the following command to do the commit. Note the message explaining why you made changes is required.\n\t\tsvn commit -m \"reason for making changes to the repo\" \n\t\tWait till that finishes. The repo is updated in the cloud and your team mates can have access to your changes when they update.\n\t\n\tIf you have trouble executing these commands, please reach out to Mark Anderson during his office hours for support.\n\t\nLinux\n\tFor Linux, the recommended client is RabbitVCS which can be downloaded from: http://www.rabbitvcs.org/. Installation instructions for Ubuntu can be found here: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/rabbitvcs-easy-version-control-for-linux.html.\n\tFor those who prefer the command line, the required commands are documented in the Mac section of this page.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Using_svnx": "\nUsing svnx - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Subversion  \n  Table of contentsUsing svnxShort VersionLonger Version\n\t\nUsing svnx\n\t\nShort Version\n\tApple changed what they bundle into the operating system. As a result you must download and install Subversion first and then download and install svnX.\n\tThe suggested method to install Subversion is to use the Mac's \"brew\" command, part of the \"homebrew\" package. This requires that first install brew from https://brew.sh/. With that installed per the instructions on their site, install Subversion by opening the Terminal and entering:brew install subversion\n\tIf there are difficulties, you may want to trouble shoot that or use an alternate method to get Subversion as found in this document: export:training/A Guide to Installing svnX on Mac.docx\n\t\n\tDownload svnX from here. NOTE - we do NOT check to see if this is the right / latest version!\n\t\n\thttps://mac.softpedia.com/get/Development/Editors/SvnX.shtml\n\t\thttps://subversion.assembla.com/svn/svnx/tags/svnX%202.0.dmg - 2.0 version - there are a few releases. All of these may STOP working with newer versions of the OS\n\t\thttps://code.google.com/archive/p/svnx/ - older 1.3x versions\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tAfter installation, launch svnX\n\t\n\tIF svnX complains that it cannot find a subversion client, you will have to manually locate it and set that location in the svnX Preferences. In the Getting Started instructions are some instructions and links for obtaining svn. There may be some versions of Mac OS that may conflict. We do NOT have a universal solution documented solution for this yet though it is being investigated and there are many web pages that should provide the answer. If/when we work this out, it will be added to this page.\n\t\tOpen a terminal window and enter: which svn\n\t\tthat will return the complete path to the svn program. If it can't find it, then you will need to install svn before you can proceed!\n\t\topen up the Preferences in svnX. Go to the General tab. There is a place to enter the svn folder name. It probably includes /svn at the end - which is incorrect. Remove the /svn part and save that. It should now work.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIF svnX complains about a security issue, you will have to first install the subversion client then run the following command in the terminal window using YOUR project's project-identifier:\n\t\n\tsvn info https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/svn2/project-identifier \n\t\twhen prompted, accept the security certificate \"p\" for permanently.\n\t\tThen svnX should be able to access your repository.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAfter launching, two windows will show up, one for repository and one for working copies. If not, you can open these from the menu.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tIn the repository window click the + to add your repository to the list:Name: name it whatever you like to call for this projectPath: https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/svn2/jabil-opt-inspUser: your EDN login user namePassword: your EDN login password\n\t\n\tAfter this is set, double click the name of the repository, and wait for it to load, you should be able to see all the files in the repository after a short delay\n\t\n\tCreate a folder somewhere in your laptop that you would like to store your working copy at\n\t\n\t\n\tGo back to the repository, click the \"Checkout\" button at the top right of the window, and navigate to the folder you just createdThis step will take anywhere from a few minutes for a new project to over an hour for a multi-semester/year project. It will copy down all of the project files to your Mac.\n\t\n\t\n\tNow, use Finder and navigate to the working folder. You should have a copy of the files from your repository.Y ou are done!

At the end of the semester, each team's work will be archived by the Project Engineer. These \"tags\" contain a snapshot of that work as of the end of each semester. The purpose of creating an archive folder is to allow a recipient to review and/or reproduce your work - even one or more semesters in the future. The structure of the tag folder is IDENTICAL to the working folder as described in the Subversion page. The folder structure for Git repositories should be exactly the same as shown on the Subversion page.\n\tSee our wiki for information on using Subversion or Git. The Subversion page explains the folder structure of a repository and the concept of \"tagging\".\n\tThe archive folder will be created in the \"tags\" folder and will be named to match your semester, as in \"Spring2012\". If your repository does not already have a tags and a working folder -- STOP! Your PE will take over the rest of this task for you.\n\tDO NOT TAG your team's work without expressed written consent of your Project Engineer because in most cases the PE will do this for your team!\n\t\nI repeat, DO NOT TAG without PE approval.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Course_Guidelines_and_Policies": "\nCourse Guidelines and Policies - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \n  \nCourse Guidelines and Policies\n\tClass TimeClass TimeProductive use of class time is critical to the team's success!

The Sponsorship Agreement (SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT 11-15-13.pdf) describes the rules for handling information provided by the sponsor that is explicitly marked confidential. Guidelines are also given for publication of project results.\n\tIt is rare that our projects require explicitly identified confidential information. It is therefore important to recognize that ALL the technical information in our projects should be given appropriate protection. The general rule is that we should share information only when it is in the best interest of the project, or when it serves appropriate educational goals. It is also acceptable to discuss appropriate project information when applying for jobs. But be aware that interviewers will respect your professionalism for limiting the information about the sponsors project that you are willing to discuss with another company.\n\tA specific issue concerns the use of Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and possibly other free e-mail services to exchange project technical information. Google, Yahoo and others may scan their email in the process of attaching relevant advertising or for marketing analysis. The risk for the release of confidential information is a matter of debate. But any such risk can be avoided by using RPI e-mail or the EDN system. The Capstone course policy is to NOT include any project technical information in messages to or from Gmail or other non-RPI addresses. Note that this risk still exists if you are forwarding all of your RPI email to a Google email account - this is not permitted.\n\tATTACHMENTS BELOW\n  Files (3)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    release_form_4may04.doc    (31 KB)\n    release_form_4may04.doc  \n  Photo release form for non-RPI individuals\n  \n      Aren Paster, 2018-08-22 07:46 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT SIGNATURE PAGE (Fillable Form).pdf    (59.7 KB)\n    SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT SIGNATURE PAGE (Fillable Form).pdf  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2021-08-19 02:08 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    STUDENT-FACULTY AGREEMENT REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY, DEVELOPMENTS  AND PRIVACY (fillable form).pdf    (89.9 KB)\n    STUDENT-FACULTY AGREEMENT REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY, DEVELOPMENTS  AND PRIVACY (fillable form).pdf  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2021-08-19 02:08 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Purchasing_Guidelines": "\nPurchasing Guidelines - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \n  Table of contentsPurchasing GuidelinesPURCHASING GUIDELINES FOR FALL 2021 CAPSTONE TEAMS!Getting startedSimplified process\nPurchasing OptionsCatalog or Internet PurchasesDirect Student PurchasesSponsor provided equipmentRPI Support ServicesFabricationChemical StockroomMRC Services\nAfter purchasingPoster Printing\n\t\nPurchasing Guidelines\n\t\n PURCHASING GUIDELINES FOR FALL 2021 CAPSTONE TEAMS!\n\tAll purchases by Capstone teams will be done electronically for the Fall 2021 semester.

Your Project Engineer will submit your documents to me with his email that he has approved the purchase.\n\tI will then place your order.  When I receive your order from the vendor, I will send you an email stating that your it has arrived.  Your order will be either given to your Project Engineer who will deliver it to you or it will be put on your team bench in the fabrication area.\n\tThe best way to contact me is via email (mastev@rpi.edu). I check my email often so I will get back to you quickly.\nNote: the mailing address for the lab is:Rensselaer \n110 Eighth Street\nMailstop JEC3018 / Attn Valerie Masterson\nTroy, NY 12180\n\tUnlike IED where students pay for all project materials, your Capstone project covers the costs for your project materials. The only anticipated team expense is for the printing poster at midterm and end of semester. As a result, it is critical that you follow the procedures outlined here!\n\tYOU WILL NEED TO PLAN AHEAD FOR ALL YOUR PURCHASES.1. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET WHAT YOU NEED THROUGH THE SYSTEM. (2 to 14 business days for in stock items)2. IF YOU DO NOT USE PREFERRED VENDORS IT WILL TAKE LONGER OR NOT BE POSSIBLE.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT PURCHASING, PLEASE CONTACT VALERIE MASTERSON EITHER BY EMAIL (mastev@rpi.edu) OR BY PHONE (518-276-2724)\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\nGetting started\n\t\nSimplified process\n\t\n\tObtain and fill out Design Lab requisition form: attachment:\"PURCHASE_FORM(Fillable_Form).pdf\" or paper copies at Valerie's desk. ONE FORM PER VENDOR please!\n\t\tFor vendor purchases, print out shopping cart. Verify you are using a preferred vendor or check with Valerie Masterson.\n\t\tYour team's Project Engineer approves the purchase before a transaction is made (see this for more info:  PE-Purchasing ).\n\t\tPurchase is processed by Valerie Masterson (office in the back of the Design Lab).\n\t\tYou will be notified by e-mail when shipment arrives.\n\t\n\tIf you purchase anything personally before approvals - you will not be reimbursed! If you purchase anything from NON-Approved vendors - you will not be reimbursed!\n\t\nPurchasing Options\n\t\nCatalog or Internet Purchases\n\t\n\tALL purchases should be sourced from RPI Preferred Vendors\n\t\n\t\nDirect Student Purchases\n\t\nSponsor provided equipment\n\t\n\tInstructions if you have a package sent to RPI\n\t\n\t\nRPI Support Services\n\t\nFabrication\n\t\n\tOn or Off Campus (Ex: Machine shop, 3D printing, rapid prototyping, Physical Facilities, Computer Store, etc.)\n\t\n\t\nChemical Stockroom\n\t\n\tChemicals and reagents, glassware, safety supplies\n\t\n\t\nMRC Services\n\t\n\tElectron Microscopy, Mechanical Testing, Metallography, NanoScale Characterization\n\t\n\t\nAfter purchasing\n\tAdd purchase to the team Bill of Materials (BOM), a comprehensive list of all the parts used by the team. Design Lab has created a template available here - Templates and FormsKeep the file in the repository so that a single BOM is continually updated. A Forum thread on purchases should be used to provide additional information such as quotes, PDF's of request forms or shopping carts, as well as details for non-standard purchases.\n\t\nPoster Printing\n\tThe cost of printing the midterm PDR poster and the end of semester final poster will NOT be reimbursed.\n\tATTACHMENTS BELOW\n  Files (4)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Valerie-50px.JPG    (49.3 KB)\n    Valerie-50px.JPG  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2018-04-04 09:45 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Valerie-100px.JPG    (51.3 KB)\n    Valerie-100px.JPG  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2018-04-04 09:46 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    PURCHASE FORM  (Fillable Form ).pdf    (320 KB)\n    PURCHASE FORM  (Fillable Form ).pdf  \n  \n  \n      Valerie Masterson, 2022-02-01 02:27 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    PURCHASE_FORM_(Fillable_Form).pdf    (320 KB)\n    PURCHASE_FORM_(Fillable_Form).pdf  \n  \n  \n      Junichi Kanai, 2022-02-02 09:06 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n      \n      \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Preferred_Vendors": "\nPreferred Vendors - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nPurchasing Guidelines  \n  \nPreferred Vendors\n\tRPI maintains a LARGE list of approved vendors in a system called OSCAR.

There are many other companies that are in the RPI Purchasing system and orders have to be done by Valerie entering a requisition.  If they are not in the RPI Purchasing system and they accept purchase orders we will have to set up a new account which will take one to two weeks before the order is placed.  These new companies must accept purchase orders.  You must check with the company to make sure they will take a purchase order and get a complete quote on their official letterhead. If the company does not accept purchase orders then you will need to bring that to the attention of Valerie Masterson and she will determine what your next option will be.\n\tAdditionally, there are a number of Local Vendors who may have the necessary parts in stock RIGHT NOW!  Please check with Valerie before any purchases are made by you.\n\tPLEASE BE AWARE THAT YOUR PROJECT ENGINEER MUST APPROVE ALL PURCHASES BEFORE A TRANSACTION IS MADE.  IF FOR SOME REASON YOUR PROJECT ENGINEER IS NOT AVAILABLE, PLEASE BRING YOUR INFORMATION TO VALERIE MASTERSON AND SHE WILL WORK WITH YOU TO GET THE SIGNATURES AND EXPEDITE THE ORDER.PLEASE CHECK INVENTORY IN THE SHOP OR ASK YOUR PE BEFORE ORDERING PARTS!!!!\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Electronics_Layout_and_Circuit_Board_Production": "\nElectronics Layout and Circuit Board Production - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Technology Related  \n  Table of contentsElectronic Schematics, Layout and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) ProductionThe Process / Workflow for creating PCB'sMaking SchematicsToolsProduction\n\t\nElectronic Schematics, Layout and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Production\n\t\nThe Process / Workflow for creating PCB's\n\thttp://electronicdesign.com/embedded/engineer-s-guide-high-quality-pcb-design - A brief guide to the overall process\n\t\nMaking Schematics\n\tThere are many videos teaching the various tools, but the main goal for a schematic (like a mechanical CAD model/drawing) is to communicate \"intent\" of your design.\n\tLook at published schematics, especially for commercial products. They are generally very clear even though they may be very complicated. While commercial schematics often require multiple sheets, we generally encourage students to keep everything to a single sheet as its usually easier to follow.\nSome tips:\n\t\n\tAvoid crossing wires.\n\t\tUse net names to avoid running long wires across / around the schematic. For example\n\t\n\tadd as many ground points as needed rather than running long lines around the diagram\n\t\tuse a net name for power then use that instead\n\t\n\t\n\t\tkeep flow from left to right, then top to bottom\n\t\tground should be on the bottom of the schematic, power source at the top. This is a common convention\n\t\torient components in their common way, i.e. Op Amps are triangles that (usually) point to the right. It's a connection that makes it easier for others to follow intent\n\t\tuse the standard graphic for parts. \n\t\n\tUsing a triangle indicates the component is an Op Amp while using a rectangle does not\n\t\tAvoid rectangles for resistors. Use the zig zag line graphic\n\t\tmake sure polarity of electrolytic capacitors / outside shield of regular ones is properly oriented when that matters. Shield side on non-polarized caps usually goes to ground if one side is grounded.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nTools\nThere are a number of tools used for electronics CAD including:\n\t\n\tEagleCAD - This is now part of the AutoCAD family and as such available free to students. This is the preferred tool to use and is fairly easy to use for schematics & board layouts..\n\t\n\tIntro material - EagleCAD_talk_v4_11_2009.pdf \n\t\tTutorial - https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-eagle/all\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOrCAD - PSpice & PCB Layout - orcad_tutor.pdf found at: http://www.8051projects.net/download-d113-orcad-tutorial-for-schematic-pcb-design.html\n\t\n\tFree student version available for download (need link)\n\t\tFree version (v 16) only supports a limited complexity (# of components / # of wires) for your circuits\n\t\tNon-free version included with a textbook (need book / course name)\n\t\n\t\n\t\tkiCAD - Open source available for Windows and Linux. \n\t\n\tNO limit on project complexity. Unlimited layers. Unlimited sheets. No board size limit or component count limit. Capstone Students have successfully used this to go from schematic to PCB.\n\t\tTutorial - http://store.curiousinventor.com/guides/kicad/\n\t\tHomepage - http://kicad-pcb.org/\n\t\tIncludes 3d preview\n\t\tAdditional libraries at: https://kicad.org/libraries/download/\n\t\thuge DigiKey library available at: https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/design-tools/kicad\n\t\n\t\n\t\tgEDA - Open source for Linux only. NO limit on project complexity.\n\t\n\tHomepage - http://www.gpleda.org/index.html\n\t\tSupports PSpice\n\t\tLinux only\n\t\tSchematic capture / PCB layout fairly eassy to learn\n\t\tSpice analysis somewhat complicated as you need to find/ add the component models\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDipTrace Lite - http://diptrace.com\n\t\n\tFree for academic use with 500 pin limit, two sided boards\n\t\tFreeware version limited to 300 pins / 2 layers\n\t\tlarge number of components included in the library\n\t\tIncludes 3d preview\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFritzing - http://fritzing.org - Although handy for pictorial / assembly diagrams, this is NOT considered a suitable alternative for drawing schematics. A Fritzing diagram is NOT a schematic. Fritzing is NOT widely used in industry although it IS widely used in the Maker / Instructables / Arduino / Middle & High School communities. Fritzing CAN be used to create schematics but is discouraged in favor of EagleCAD or KiCAD.\n\t\n\tOn Linux you can use EagleCAD or a number of Spice related packages including Oregano and Gschem. Oregano includes a small number of device models needed to run simulations. Gschem lets you run simulations using ng-spice or GNUCAP but does not include the models.\n\tThere are MANY (other) tutorials for all of these as well as videos posted to YouTube. Do a little searching to find these!\n\tWhich is best? Much web searching indicates that NONE of these are the \"best\". All work and can be used to create a schematic which can then be turned into a PCB. Some Open Source applications may require a little more work to get running or to get used to them - but that are inherently available to all!\n\t\nProduction\n\tThere are MANY PCB makers that can be found online. The following are a few that we have had some experience with in the Lab or that faculty / staff / students have used. You will need to search for them online to get more details and current information like price / delivery time. For some BMED projects (and some others) you might want to make sure they do ROHS processing.\n\t\n\tDfrobot :  used by one of the faculty a lot for quantity 10-150 boards - very affordable.\n\t\telefreaks (overseas) can get them from 11 days standard down to about 7 for a price - this is for multiple boards\n\t\t4PCB (US) has fast turnaround, usually small quantity, may be costly but good results\n\t\tBayAreaCircuits : http://instantdfm.bayareacircuits.com - very professional service, fast service (down to 1 day turnaround at a price!), or to mass produce a particular board. Suggest using DIPTRACE CAD software, as you get a better deal than going to them directly. Through DIPTRACE, there is a $35 dollar minimum (5/8/14), and the following specs apply:\n\t\n\t0.062 thick\n\t\tFR4 (standard temp for 2 layers, high temp for 4-6 layers)\n\t\t5/5 min trace and space\n\t\tHASL finish\n\t\t0.010 smallest finished hole size\n\t\tgreen solder mask - You can choose your own color solder mask by going directly to the company, but you will pay dearly for this\n\t\tThey have student deals but they aren't that great. They can do up to 40 layers--doubt that will be of interest--and fancy routing if you require it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tOSH park: https://oshpark.com - There is a minimum order of 3 boards but of any size and you don't have to pay for more than you need. OSH waits until they have enough different designs on a panel and then send off to the fab. They save a lot of money this way and pass that on to the consumer.

PSoC stands for 'Programmable System on a Chip'.\nThere are multiple families that the lab has been exposed to:\n\t\n\tPSoC3\n\t\tPSoC5LP - low power\n\t\tPSoC4 - available in the Pioneer Kit (with Arduino shield compatible interface) or as a thumb drive sized board with headers.\n\t\tPSoC4BLE - Bluetooth Low Energy. The motherboard is a Pioneer Kit Arduino shield compatible board but the actual PSoC BLE is a daughter board that can be programmed then removed for installation into a project.\n\t\tPsoC6 - Includes either both WiFi / Bluetooth or Bluetooth alone, as they are targeted for IoT development.\n\t\n\tWe have a small set of development kits for these. See Booty Bay to reserve one for your project. New ones may be purchased / obtained if needed.\n\tWhile many teams worry about the physical size of the microprocessor they use, it should be remembered that you are typically using an evaluation or ready made board for your prototyping. Unless your team is chartered to make the final \"production\" model (VERY FEW teams are in this mode), the board size is likely to not be as significant an issue as initially thought. For teams that DO require a final dimensions sized solution, they simply layout and fabricate a board to their specs. For all of these, the actual surface mount processor size is about .5\" square.\n\t\nSupport Materials\n\tWe have a number of support materials and training workshops that can be found in the repository at source:PSoC Note that the PSoC4 is essentially the same as the PSoC4BLE - except without the BLE!\n\tCypress worked with Element 14, a large distributor) to develop a series of projects as samples. These are their \"100 Projects in 100 Days\" items found at:\n\thttps://www.element14.com/community/thread/23736/l/100-projects-in-100-days\n\tA Cypress funded Capstone team worked with their engineering support and developed a PSoC5LP board. Two of the students, with Cypress blessing and support, launcheda Kickstarter and began their own company based on this new board: https://www.embeditelectronics.com/\n\tCypress has an enormous amount of support and training material on their own website. Search for their videos that teach not only the development environment (their IDE) but also how to properly apply the products.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/PsoC6": "\nPsoC6 - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.');

It should include:\n\t\n\tauthor\n\t\tcreation date\n\t\tpurpose\n\t\tappropriate copyright notice (see your Project Engineer)\n\t\nThe file will then contain one or more modules/functions/etc. Each should have it's own comment header that includes:\n\t\n\tpurpose / function performed\n\t\tauthor name\n\t\tdate\n\t\tinputs\n\t\toutputs\n\t\n\tIt is also helpful to include a revision history / change log whenever significant functional changes are made.\n\t\nDocumentation Tools\nDepending on the programming language, one of the following may be helpful:\n\t\n\tPydoc\n\t\tJavadoc\n\t\tDoxygen\n\t\tJupityer Notebooks\n\t\n\tPydoc - if using a virtual python environment, you must activate your environment then use python -m pydoc so that pyfoc references the correct software versions as defined in that environment.\n\t\nScrum / Agile Programming\n\tThis is a great short presentation on YouTube that explains what a Scrum is - http://youtu.be/kYajjGi5-qMThis approach is great for short term software project development - such as would occur during a 15 week semester!\n\t\nInternet of Things\n\t\nAI / Machine Learning\n\t\niPad\n\t\nTransformer TF101/TF201\n\t\nRaspberry Pi\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/MySQL": "\nMySQL - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Computers  Software  Hardware  Networking  \n  \nMySQL\n\t\nWhitepapers On Integration between MySQL and Office Products\nThese whitepapers will be helpful for Windows users in particular:\n\t\n\tmysql_wp_access_frontends.pdf\n\t\tmysql_wp_Excel_guide.en.pdf \n\t\tmysql_wp_windows.en.pdf\n\t\n\tYou can download all of the software from the Oracle web site: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/\n\t\nDeveloping on Windows\n\tIf you are doing website development on Windows then we recommend that you download the complete integrated set of tools: Apache / MySQL / PHP for Windows. This is usually referred to as the WAMP server package (\"W\" as in \"Windows\"). The equivalent LAMP (\"L\" as n Linux) package is usually either already part of your Linux distribution or can be downloaded through the package manager.\n\tThe WampServer website is: http://www.wampserver.com/en/\n\t\nDeveloping on Linux\n\tInstructions on building a complete virtual machine that includes MySQL can be found at Building a Generic Ubuntu LAMP Server\n\t\nUsing phpMyAdmin To Access The Database\n\t\nUsing MySQL Workbench To Access The Database\n\tAlthough you can use phpMyAdmin locally, you cannot readily, due to security constraints, use it to access a remote database such as on a server located on campus. For this, MySQL Workbench is the appropriate solution. It can be downloaded from the MySQL website.\n\tThe necessary step to access the remote database is the use of a TCP over SSH connection. This will, within the Workbench, create a secure connection to the server and allow full access to the database. The key is to create a connection configured as shown below:\nThe key information to note is that in this example:\n\t\n\tthe Connection Method has been set to Standard TCP/IP over SSH which changes the rest of the screen to the needed parameters as shown\n\t\tthe MySQL server is running on mdl-vm1.eng.rpi.edu with anderm8 being a Linux operating system account on that node\n\t\tdb_user would be the MySQL account needed to access the database\n\t\tthe passwords are not visible here - they are stored in the keychain to avoid having to re-enter them every time\n\t\n\tNote - NOTHING on the Remote Management, System Profile, SSL or Advanced tabs needs to be changed!\nFrom the front page of the Workbench you can now click on this connection and will be connected to your database on the \n\t\n\tdog_collar is the name of the database that db_user has permission to access.\n\t\n\tOne great feature is that you can export, edit and then import CSV files to help you populate your tables with meaningful data! Be careful if your database structure changers as the old CSV files may no longer work without editing.\n  Files (4)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    mysql_wp_access_frontends.pdf    (1.85 MB)\n    mysql_wp_access_frontends.pdf  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2011-02-09 07:36 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    mysql_wp_Excel_guide.en.pdf    (2.5 MB)\n    mysql_wp_Excel_guide.en.pdf  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2011-02-09 07:38 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    mysql_wp_windows.en.pdf    (895 KB)\n    mysql_wp_windows.en.pdf  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2011-02-09 07:38 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    MySQL_Accessing_remote_database_using_TCP_over_SSH.png    (171 KB)\n    MySQL_Accessing_remote_database_using_TCP_over_SSH.png  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2020-04-24 11:28 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n      \n      \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Building_a_Generic_Ubuntu_LAMP_Server": "\nBuilding a generic Ubuntu LAMP server - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Computers  Software  Hardware  Networking  Virtual Machines  \n  Table of contentsBuilding a Generic Ubuntu LAMP ServerCreate the Virtual MachineOperating System InstallationNetwork Configuration - NATNetwork Configuration - Bridged / Fixed IPMQTT\nLAMP Software InstallationApplication Software InstallationProductivity ToolsNetwork ToolsMiscellaneousSubversion Client - RabbitVCS\nDjango Web application frameworkSystem Software SetupFolder Structure and Configuration for Each ProjectDatabase NoteServing the Django Website from Apache\nUsing your New Virtual Machine / LAMP Based Django ServerAdditional Resources\n\t\nBuilding a Generic Ubuntu LAMP Server\n\tThese instructions assume that you have already installed VirtualBox and downloaded the latest Ubuntu LTS ISO. Note that the process is similar for other releases and for other distributions. The commands shown below, however, have only been tested/verified on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS.\n\tThe host computer can be Windows, Linux or Mac. All of this works the same regardless of the host computer details which is part of the power of using virtual machines (VM's).\n\t\nCreate the Virtual Machine\n\tFrom the VirtualBox GUI, create a new machine. When prompted, choose Linux for the type and Ubuntu 64bit for the operating system. Take the next few defaults. For disk space provide at least 12GB, preferably 14GM and if you have room, then allow 16GB - more if you have plans for an application that requires a lot of disk space. You CAN add disk space later. This will be explained later during the Operating system installation.\n\tOnce you have created the virtual machine, you essentially have your own personal computer that happens to \"live inside\" of your PC.\n\tBefore \"booting\" your PC, we need to adjust some settings.\n\t\n\tSystem - set the RAM to 2GB, higher if you have memory to spare. Anything beyond 4G will be wasted for most virtual machines.\n\t\tDisplay - select the maximum video ram. Do not select 3D or 2D graphics.\n\t\tNetwork - if creating a virtual machine to act as a server, then you will need a predefined IP address. Note that the Design Lab has reserved a set of IP addresses. See Mark Anderson BEFORE you use any of these! For this case, choose \"Bridged\". For personal use only, NAT is the correct choice and does not require a pre-allocated IP address.\n\t\tSerial Ports - no changes\n\t\tUSB - no changes\n\t\tShared folders - no changes\n\t\tUser Interface - no changes\n\t\n\t\nOperating System Installation\n\tAs you would for any new PC, the operating system must now be installed. Go to the Storage section of your new virtual machine and click on the Empty item for the IDE controller. Then, using the pull down on the right, select the disk icon next to the Removable Drive and from there, Choose Optical Disk file. Locate and select the previously downloaded ISO file for the operating system you wish to install. This is equivalent to putting a disk in the DVD drive on a real PC. Select Live CD because that is how the Linux distribution media works. Note that the Design Lab standard is Ubuntu, latest version for new virtual machines.\n\tNow that your virtual PC is configured, you may click on the Start arrow in the GUI to \"boot\" your machine. It will now load your live disk allowing you to either try or install the operating system. In this case, we wish to Install.\n\tUbuntu will now present it's current set of installation questions. The defaults will mostly work fine. One exception is that we recommend the use of LVM for the disk setup. This makes it very easy to add a second disk later if your VM needs to expand.\n\tAll VM's built by the Design Lab will include an account for either Mark Anderson or Junichi Kanai or both. All VM's built by students will have one or both of these accounts added as a condition of hosting. Mark and Junichi will have administrator access so that e can provide support as needed.\n\tAll VM's should use a team-wide account to ensure that work done on the server is accessible by the entire team and later by the sponsor. The team-wide account information must appear in your team's wiki with both user name and password.\n\tThe team-wide account will generally be given administrator privileges so that you can install software as needed on your VM.\n\tIt is highly recommended that you install the Guest Editions. On the Virtual Machine's menu bar, choose Devices, then\n\tAt this point you will have a fully functioning virtual machine. It will NOT yet have the fixed IP address as that must be manually configured and for NAT it may have access to the network. If you chose NAT for use in a personal machine, the network may have to be enabled. If you are using Bridged to provide a server at a fixed IP address, then additional configuration is required before activation of the network.\n\tIt is recommended that, after installing the operating system, you install the Guest Editions. Installing this is highly recommended to gain the advantages of an improved full screen user interface and the ability to copy/paste between your PC and the virtual machine.\n\t\nNetwork Configuration - NAT\n\tIf the network is working, then this can be skipped. Note - this was apparently a one-time issue, possibly caused by an early release of Ubuntu 20 as this \"fix\" has not been needed.\nMust edit \"/sysconfig/???\" \n\t\n\tchange to \"on\" \n\t\trestart networking\n\t\n\t\nNetwork Configuration - Bridged / Fixed IP\nMust edit \"\" \n\t\n\tchange to \"on\" \n\t\tset fixed IP stuff\n\t\trestart networking\n\t\n\t\nMQTT\n\tIoT applications may elect to use the MQTT approach. To install this software:# Install Mosquitto Broker and clients\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients\n\tNote that this does not install / enable any security for MQTT. That can be added at a later time.\n\tUse of MQTT does NOT require LAMP installation.\n\tAnother typical method used for IoT applications is to use Django (see below). IoT applications can use the RESTful API implemented by Django to have their devices interact with a server. This approach is beneficial when one or more web based apps are required. Note that MQTT and Django can also  both be used.\n\t\nLAMP Software Installation\n\t(turn on shared clipboard bidirectional)\n\t\n\t\tNOTE - this page is revised as/when installation changes are identified, e.g. due to Ubuntu operating system updates. It represents the best information we currently have as of the last update to this page. If you learn / discover something that requires a change, please notify Mark Anderson, the page maintainer.\n\t\n\tWith Ubuntu installed we have the \"L\" in LAMP. Now install Apache web server, MySQL. If PHP is needed, it can be installed (not always needed but standard to \"LAMP\"). We will not perform all the steps to create a very secure server - only the minimal steps to create a working one.\n# make sure we have the latest of everything for this version of this release of Ubuntu\n# do these two commands one at a time\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt -y upgrade\n# the A in LAMP\nsudo apt install -y apache2\n# ON the virtual machine, opening the browser and going to http://localhost will bring up an Apache default page, showing that this worked. \n# now the M\nsudo apt install -y mysql-server\n# the above can be copied / pasted as a block of commands. \n# The mysql_secure_installation command will ask several questions - so do not paste it in as part of a block!\n# now it must be configured for the first time\nsudo mysql_secure_installation\n# can say no to validate password component used to enforce long passwords\n# be sure to document in your team wiki whatever password you use for the root MySQL account.\n# note that this is NOT the same as the operating system's root account\n# take the remaining defaults\n# if needed, can install the P\nsudo apt install -y php\n\tYou can access MySQL as root without a password using:sudo mysql -u root\n\tThis completes the essential completion of a LAMP server, ready for other application software as needed.\n\t\nApplication Software Installation\n\tThere are some common utility applications any many more that might be project specific. This section will include some of each from which you can elect items to include.\n\t\nProductivity Tools\n\t\nNetwork Tools\n# provide tools such as ifconfig\nsudo apt install -y net-tools\n# MANDATORY !!! for remote logins\nsudo apt install -y openssh-server\n\t\nMiscellaneous\n# Geany text editor. \n# Similar to Notepad++ on Windows. Personal preference.\nsudo apt install -y geany libvte9\n# for command line, ability to show a directory tree\nsudo apt install -y tree\n# lets you interact with MySQL database via a GUI\n# on Ubuntu <= 18:\n#sudo apt install -y mysql-workbench\n# to run it on Ubuntu 18, the command is: mysql-workbench\n# on Ubuntu 20\nsudo snap install mysql-workbench-community\n# let the password manager do it's job!\nsudo snap connect mysql-workbench-community:password-manager-service :password-manager-service\n# to run it on Ubuntu 20, the command is now: mysql-workbench-community\n\t\nSubversion Client - RabbitVCS\n\tWorks in a manner similar  to TortoiseSVN on Windows. It is accessed by right clicking within the Nautilus file manager.sudo apt install -y rabbitvcs-nautilus\n\tThe command line interface for Subversion is also installed:sudo apt -y install subversion\n\tNote that this may already installed on Ubuntu 20. It is harmless to try to install a package if it's already installed.\n\tAt the command line type \"svn help\" for guidance.\n\t\nDjango Web application framework\n\tDo NOT use old instructions, such as those relating to Ubuntu 16.04, as there are enough differences to make it fail. For example, for Python 3, be sure to use venv, not the older virtualenv\n\tThe following commands can be copied from here and pasted into a shell script file for later edit & execution. Note that these instructions use the anderm8 account which must be changed for your individual project usage. Do not simply copy these into the command line as all of the commands involving the folder names will fail!\n\t\nSystem Software Setup\n\tThese things are done once for the system.\nsudo apt update\n# Apache extras first\nsudo apt install -y apache2 apache2-utils apache2-dev\n# if this was accidentally installed, it provides support for Python 2.x, not 3.x\n# so remove it!\nsudo apt remove libapache2-mod-python libapache2-mod-wsgi\n# this version is required for Python 3.x\nsudo apt install -y libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3\nsudo a2enmod wsgi\npython3 -V\nsudo apt install -y python3-pip\nsudo apt install -y python3-venv\n# to access MySql from Python3 needs some more software installed\nsudo apt install -y python-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev\nsudo apt install -y python3-dev libmysqlclient-dev\n\tThe above set up the software environment. The following would need to be done for each user account.\n\t\nFolder Structure and Configuration for Each Project\n\tThese things must be done by each user, for each separate Django project they wish to create. Here, our Django project will be called \"example\". Do NOT call your project example! DO figure out a meaningful name from the start as it is NOT easy to change it later.\n\tThese commands will create some of the required folder structure.cd ~/Documents\nmkdir -p django/project/example\n# set up a place for the static files to be served from\nmkdir -p django/project/example/static\ncd django\n# next, one time creation of the Python environment. Name is arbitrary.\n# EVERYONE needs to do this on their own development environment! And once on a server!\npython3 -m venv env\n# every time we want to use it, must use the source command\nsource env/bin/activate\n# now install django IN this environment (one time)\n# these MUST be done after you activate this virtual environment!\npip install django\n# and confirm it\ndjango-admin --version\n# this is needed to these items\npip install wheel\npip install mod_wsgi\npip install mysqlclient\ncd django/project\n# ONLY FOR NEW PROJECTS\n# now can create projects...\n# for THIS example, we'll use example. \n# Be sure to use a meaningful name for YOUR project instead\n# and then adjust these instructions accordingly.\ndjango-admin startproject example\n# IF you are working with an ongoing project, you will use subversion to check out a copy of the project into the\n# ~/Documents/django/project/ folder.\n# Moving forward we'll assume that either the new or existing project was named \"example\" \ncd example\n# FOR NEW PROJECTS manually edit the example/settings.py file\n# For existing projects, this should have already been done! But you can double check!\n# ALLOWED_HOSTS = []\n# line to allow any host -> change [] to be ['*'], i.e.\n# ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']\n# this can be done with nano from the command line\n# this change is not required to connect from inside the VM with the localhost\n# create a MySQL database and user for this project\n# assuming the root password is just password. Note the required use of sudo for this\n# You can use other usernames - just make note of them as you'll have to tell Django this information to gain access to the database\nsudo mysql -u root\nCREATE DATABASE iot;\nCREATE USER 'iot_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#!iot!#';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON iot.* TO 'iot_user'@'localhost';\nexit\n# with the database in place, you can \"migrate\" the data models into the actual database\n# This sets up the database to match the latest definitions of the Django project's models\npython manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\n# with a database defined it is now possible to define one or more superusers\n# The Django superuser can log in as an admin and then has access to some of the models and other admin functions.\n# I used capstone / password and told it to accept the weak password\n# also created one for anderm8\npython manage.py createsuperuser\n# with the above steps completed, it is now possible to start your Django project\n#run server specifying permission for any host at port 8000. If this port is in use by a team mate, you can use a higher number, ex: 8001, 8002, etc.\npython manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n# should now be able see Django screen on a web browser by visiting: http://localhost:8000 \n\tThe default database for Django is sqlite. Now you must manually edit the example/settings.py file to select MySQL instead of sqlite and to set the db_name, db_user, and db_password to match the above.\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\n        'NAME': 'iot',\n        'USER': 'iot_user',\n        'PASSWORD': '#!iot!#',\n        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',\n    }\n}\n\tYou will then need to redo the migrations:python manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\nto set things up in the MySQL database.\n\tYou will also need to recreate the superusers as their info is stored in the active database.python manage.py createsuperuser\n\t\nDatabase Note\n\tThe account above is only given access to the database intended for Django usage. that user does NOT have the required privileges needed to create a new table for any other purposes.\n\tTo create other databases, you need to have root privileges as shown above. It is recommended that you create other different user names to access any other non-Django databases to help keep things modular.\n\t\nServing the Django Website from Apache\n\tWhile the \"runserver\" approach documented above works for development purposes, the \"production\" version of the website should be set to run under Apache.\n\tTo serve the website available from Apache requires manual editing of the virtual host configuration file found at /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf You may have to make multiple edits to that file depending on where you placed your Django project and the specific folder structure you used.\n\tA sample file is attached to this page that serves the sample application created above. 000-default.conf\n\t\nUsing your New Virtual Machine / LAMP Based Django Server\n\tWhen you create the environment folder, keep it OUTSIDE your project folder. DO NOT commit the environment to your repository! That just wastes space. It takes only minutes to regenerate a fresh environment as needed - so no need to store it!\n\tBe sure to \"source\" your environment each time you start work. If you try to run python manage.py commands and they fail - it's probably because you forgot to do this and as a result it's attempting to use Python 2.x - which will not work with your Django Python 3.x environment.\n\tBe sure to \"svn update\" your working copy before you start work so that you have the most recent team work.\n\tAs a team, figure out what your project / app naming conventions will be ahead of time. Use meaningful names. Do NOT simply copy the above process so that all future Django projects are named iot_rpi! It is NOT easy to change project or app names later!\n\tDo NOT work on your project as the root user! Be in \"root\" mode ONLY to make operating system changes such as installing new programs or editing the Apache site configuration file.\n\t\nAdditional Resources\n\tFor more info on using / working with this framework, please visit the Django page.\nThe following is a partial list of websites that were helpful in creating these instructions.

Each developer can have their own personal VM, develop software locally and then commit working code to the repository.

Note that the process is similar for other releases and for other distributions. The commands shown below, however, have only been tested/verified on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS.\n\tThe host computer can be Windows, Linux or Mac. All of this works the same regardless of the host computer details which is part of the power of using virtual machines (VM's).\n\t\nCreate the Virtual Machine\n\tFrom the VirtualBox GUI, create a new machine. When prompted, choose Linux for the type and Ubuntu 64bit for the operating system. Take the next few defaults. For disk space provide at least 12GB, preferably 14GM and if you have room, then allow 16GB - more if you have plans for an application that requires a lot of disk space. You CAN add disk space later. This will be explained later during the Operating system installation.\n\tOnce you have created the virtual machine, you essentially have your own personal computer that happens to \"live inside\" of your PC.\n\tBefore \"booting\" your PC, we need to adjust some settings.\n\t\n\tSystem - set the RAM to 2GB, higher if you have memory to spare. Anything beyond 4G will be wasted for most virtual machines.\n\t\tDisplay - select the maximum video ram. Do not select 3D or 2D graphics.\n\t\tNetwork - if creating a virtual machine to act as a server, then you will need a predefined IP address. Note that the Design Lab has reserved a set of IP addresses. See Mark Anderson BEFORE you use any of these! For this case, choose \"Bridged\". For personal use only, NAT is the correct choice and does not require a pre-allocated IP address.\n\t\tSerial Ports - no changes\n\t\tUSB - no changes\n\t\tShared folders - no changes\n\t\tUser Interface - no changes\n\t\n\t\nOperating System Installation\n\tAs you would for any new PC, the operating system must now be installed. Go to the Storage section of your new virtual machine and click on the Empty item for the IDE controller. Then, using the pull down on the right, select the disk icon next to the Removable Drive and from there, Choose Optical Disk file. Locate and select the previously downloaded ISO file for the operating system you wish to install. This is equivalent to putting a disk in the DVD drive on a real PC. Select Live CD because that is how the Linux distribution media works. Note that the Design Lab standard is Ubuntu, latest version for new virtual machines.\n\tNow that your virtual PC is configured, you may click on the Start arrow in the GUI to \"boot\" your machine. It will now load your live disk allowing you to either try or install the operating system. In this case, we wish to Install.\n\tUbuntu will now present it's current set of installation questions. The defaults will mostly work fine. One exception is that we recommend the use of LVM for the disk setup. This makes it very easy to add a second disk later if your VM needs to expand.\n\tAll VM's built by the Design Lab will include an account for either Mark Anderson or Junichi Kanai or both. All VM's built by students will have one or both of these accounts added as a condition of hosting. Mark and Junichi will have administrator access so that e can provide support as needed.\n\tAll VM's should use a team-wide account to ensure that work done on the server is accessible by the entire team and later by the sponsor. The team-wide account information must appear in your team's wiki with both user name and password.\n\tThe team-wide account will generally be given administrator privileges so that you can install software as needed on your VM.\n\tIt is highly recommended that you install the Guest Editions. On the Virtual Machine's menu bar, choose Devices, then\n\tAt this point you will have a fully functioning virtual machine. It will NOT yet have the fixed IP address as that must be manually configured and for NAT it may have access to the network. If you chose NAT for use in a personal machine, the network may have to be enabled. If you are using Bridged to provide a server at a fixed IP address, then additional configuration is required before activation of the network.\n\tIt is recommended that, after installing the operating system, you install the Guest Editions. Installing this is highly recommended to gain the advantages of an improved full screen user interface and the ability to copy/paste between your PC and the virtual machine.\n\t\nNetwork Configuration - NAT\n\tIf the network is working, then this can be skipped. Note - this was apparently a one-time issue, possibly caused by an early release of Ubuntu 20 as this \"fix\" has not been needed.\nMust edit \"/sysconfig/???\" \n\t\n\tchange to \"on\" \n\t\trestart networking\n\t\n\t\nNetwork Configuration - Bridged / Fixed IP\nMust edit \"\" \n\t\n\tchange to \"on\" \n\t\tset fixed IP stuff\n\t\trestart networking\n\t\n\t\nMQTT\n\tIoT applications may elect to use the MQTT approach. To install this software:# Install Mosquitto Broker and clients\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients\n\tNote that this does not install / enable any security for MQTT. That can be added at a later time.\n\tUse of MQTT does NOT require LAMP installation.\n\tAnother typical method used for IoT applications is to use Django (see below). IoT applications can use the RESTful API implemented by Django to have their devices interact with a server. This approach is beneficial when one or more web based apps are required. Note that MQTT and Django can also  both be used.\n\t\nLAMP Software Installation\n\t(turn on shared clipboard bidirectional)\n\t\n\t\tNOTE - this page is revised as/when installation changes are identified, e.g. due to Ubuntu operating system updates. It represents the best information we currently have as of the last update to this page. If you learn / discover something that requires a change, please notify Mark Anderson, the page maintainer.\n\t\n\tWith Ubuntu installed we have the \"L\" in LAMP. Now install Apache web server, MySQL. If PHP is needed, it can be installed (not always needed but standard to \"LAMP\"). We will not perform all the steps to create a very secure server - only the minimal steps to create a working one.\n# make sure we have the latest of everything for this version of this release of Ubuntu\n# do these two commands one at a time\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt -y upgrade\n# the A in LAMP\nsudo apt install -y apache2\n# ON the virtual machine, opening the browser and going to http://localhost will bring up an Apache default page, showing that this worked. \n# now the M\nsudo apt install -y mysql-server\n# the above can be copied / pasted as a block of commands. \n# The mysql_secure_installation command will ask several questions - so do not paste it in as part of a block!\n# now it must be configured for the first time\nsudo mysql_secure_installation\n# can say no to validate password component used to enforce long passwords\n# be sure to document in your team wiki whatever password you use for the root MySQL account.\n# note that this is NOT the same as the operating system's root account\n# take the remaining defaults\n# if needed, can install the P\nsudo apt install -y php\n\tYou can access MySQL as root without a password using:sudo mysql -u root\n\tThis completes the essential completion of a LAMP server, ready for other application software as needed.\n\t\nApplication Software Installation\n\tThere are some common utility applications any many more that might be project specific. This section will include some of each from which you can elect items to include.\n\t\nProductivity Tools\n\t\nNetwork Tools\n# provide tools such as ifconfig\nsudo apt install -y net-tools\n# MANDATORY !!! for remote logins\nsudo apt install -y openssh-server\n\t\nMiscellaneous\n# Geany text editor. \n# Similar to Notepad++ on Windows. Personal preference.\nsudo apt install -y geany libvte9\n# for command line, ability to show a directory tree\nsudo apt install -y tree\n# lets you interact with MySQL database via a GUI\n# on Ubuntu <= 18:\n#sudo apt install -y mysql-workbench\n# to run it on Ubuntu 18, the command is: mysql-workbench\n# on Ubuntu 20\nsudo snap install mysql-workbench-community\n# let the password manager do it's job!\nsudo snap connect mysql-workbench-community:password-manager-service :password-manager-service\n# to run it on Ubuntu 20, the command is now: mysql-workbench-community\n\t\nSubversion Client - RabbitVCS\n\tWorks in a manner similar  to TortoiseSVN on Windows. It is accessed by right clicking within the Nautilus file manager.sudo apt install -y rabbitvcs-nautilus\n\tThe command line interface for Subversion is also installed:sudo apt -y install subversion\n\tNote that this may already installed on Ubuntu 20. It is harmless to try to install a package if it's already installed.\n\tAt the command line type \"svn help\" for guidance.\n\t\nDjango Web application framework\n\tDo NOT use old instructions, such as those relating to Ubuntu 16.04, as there are enough differences to make it fail. For example, for Python 3, be sure to use venv, not the older virtualenv\n\tThe following commands can be copied from here and pasted into a shell script file for later edit & execution. Note that these instructions use the anderm8 account which must be changed for your individual project usage. Do not simply copy these into the command line as all of the commands involving the folder names will fail!\n\t\nSystem Software Setup\n\tThese things are done once for the system.\nsudo apt update\n# Apache extras first\nsudo apt install -y apache2 apache2-utils apache2-dev\n# if this was accidentally installed, it provides support for Python 2.x, not 3.x\n# so remove it!\nsudo apt remove libapache2-mod-python libapache2-mod-wsgi\n# this version is required for Python 3.x\nsudo apt install -y libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3\nsudo a2enmod wsgi\npython3 -V\nsudo apt install -y python3-pip\nsudo apt install -y python3-venv\n# to access MySql from Python3 needs some more software installed\nsudo apt install -y python-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev\nsudo apt install -y python3-dev libmysqlclient-dev\n\tThe above set up the software environment. The following would need to be done for each user account.\n\t\nFolder Structure and Configuration for Each Project\n\tThese things must be done by each user, for each separate Django project they wish to create. Here, our Django project will be called \"example\". Do NOT call your project example! DO figure out a meaningful name from the start as it is NOT easy to change it later.\n\tThese commands will create some of the required folder structure.cd ~/Documents\nmkdir -p django/project/example\n# set up a place for the static files to be served from\nmkdir -p django/project/example/static\ncd django\n# next, one time creation of the Python environment. Name is arbitrary.\n# EVERYONE needs to do this on their own development environment! And once on a server!\npython3 -m venv env\n# every time we want to use it, must use the source command\nsource env/bin/activate\n# now install django IN this environment (one time)\n# these MUST be done after you activate this virtual environment!\npip install django\n# and confirm it\ndjango-admin --version\n# this is needed to these items\npip install wheel\npip install mod_wsgi\npip install mysqlclient\ncd django/project\n# ONLY FOR NEW PROJECTS\n# now can create projects...\n# for THIS example, we'll use example. \n# Be sure to use a meaningful name for YOUR project instead\n# and then adjust these instructions accordingly.\ndjango-admin startproject example\n# IF you are working with an ongoing project, you will use subversion to check out a copy of the project into the\n# ~/Documents/django/project/ folder.\n# Moving forward we'll assume that either the new or existing project was named \"example\" \ncd example\n# FOR NEW PROJECTS manually edit the example/settings.py file\n# For existing projects, this should have already been done! But you can double check!\n# ALLOWED_HOSTS = []\n# line to allow any host -> change [] to be ['*'], i.e.\n# ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']\n# this can be done with nano from the command line\n# this change is not required to connect from inside the VM with the localhost\n# create a MySQL database and user for this project\n# assuming the root password is just password. Note the required use of sudo for this\n# You can use other usernames - just make note of them as you'll have to tell Django this information to gain access to the database\nsudo mysql -u root\nCREATE DATABASE iot;\nCREATE USER 'iot_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '#!iot!#';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON iot.* TO 'iot_user'@'localhost';\nexit\n# with the database in place, you can \"migrate\" the data models into the actual database\n# This sets up the database to match the latest definitions of the Django project's models\npython manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\n# with a database defined it is now possible to define one or more superusers\n# The Django superuser can log in as an admin and then has access to some of the models and other admin functions.\n# I used capstone / password and told it to accept the weak password\n# also created one for anderm8\npython manage.py createsuperuser\n# with the above steps completed, it is now possible to start your Django project\n#run server specifying permission for any host at port 8000. If this port is in use by a team mate, you can use a higher number, ex: 8001, 8002, etc.\npython manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n# should now be able see Django screen on a web browser by visiting: http://localhost:8000 \n\tThe default database for Django is sqlite. Now you must manually edit the example/settings.py file to select MySQL instead of sqlite and to set the db_name, db_user, and db_password to match the above.\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',\n        'NAME': 'iot',\n        'USER': 'iot_user',\n        'PASSWORD': '#!iot!#',\n        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',\n    }\n}\n\tYou will then need to redo the migrations:python manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\nto set things up in the MySQL database.\n\tYou will also need to recreate the superusers as their info is stored in the active database.python manage.py createsuperuser\n\t\nDatabase Note\n\tThe account above is only given access to the database intended for Django usage. that user does NOT have the required privileges needed to create a new table for any other purposes.\n\tTo create other databases, you need to have root privileges as shown above. It is recommended that you create other different user names to access any other non-Django databases to help keep things modular.\n\t\nServing the Django Website from Apache\n\tWhile the \"runserver\" approach documented above works for development purposes, the \"production\" version of the website should be set to run under Apache.\n\tTo serve the website available from Apache requires manual editing of the virtual host configuration file found at /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf You may have to make multiple edits to that file depending on where you placed your Django project and the specific folder structure you used.\n\tA sample file is attached to this page that serves the sample application created above. 000-default.conf\n\t\nUsing your New Virtual Machine / LAMP Based Django Server\n\tWhen you create the environment folder, keep it OUTSIDE your project folder. DO NOT commit the environment to your repository! That just wastes space. It takes only minutes to regenerate a fresh environment as needed - so no need to store it!\n\tBe sure to \"source\" your environment each time you start work. If you try to run python manage.py commands and they fail - it's probably because you forgot to do this and as a result it's attempting to use Python 2.x - which will not work with your Django Python 3.x environment.\n\tBe sure to \"svn update\" your working copy before you start work so that you have the most recent team work.\n\tAs a team, figure out what your project / app naming conventions will be ahead of time. Use meaningful names. Do NOT simply copy the above process so that all future Django projects are named iot_rpi! It is NOT easy to change project or app names later!\n\tDo NOT work on your project as the root user! Be in \"root\" mode ONLY to make operating system changes such as installing new programs or editing the Apache site configuration file.\n\t\nAdditional Resources\n\tFor more info on using / working with this framework, please visit the Django page.\nThe following is a partial list of websites that were helpful in creating these instructions.

When it does so, it lacks the Django framework and generates errors.\n\tA solution was derived from this page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24772805/python-documentation-for-django-views-generic-with-pydoc by changing from cli mode to browser mode.\n\tCreate this as a file called my_pydoc.py in the same folder as your manage.py file for the project:import django\nimport pydoc\nimport os\nos.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'iot_rpi.settings'\ndjango.setup()\n#pydoc.cli()\npydoc.browse(9999)\n\tNow, from within your Python virtual environment (remember to use the \"source\" command!) run this to start your web browser with the documentation:python -m my_pydoc\n\tYou should now be able to access the documentation for your Django project and it's apps - as well as documentation for Python itself.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/VirtualBox": "\nVirtualBox - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Computers  Software  Hardware  Networking  Virtual Machines  \n  \nVirtualBox\n\tAlthough the lab used VMware previously, VirtualBox has become our de-facto standard, usually running a long term support version of Ubuntu.\n\t\nTips\n\tIn the virtual machine's (VM's) configuration on the host computer, turn off \"nested paging\" (on the System section) to remove a harmless but annoying message about \"PXII_smbus not available\".\n\tIf you cannot get a 64bit virtual machine created on an Intel based machine, check in the BIOS that HyperV is permitted. This will require a reboot to check / change.\n\t\nAccessing the Virtual Machine From the Network\n\tWhile the typical setup for personal virtual machines (VMs) uses the NAT network setting, that intentionally limits external access to the VM. With your host computer (laptop, desktop, etc.) on a wired ethernet, you can simply change the network setting to bridged and in the VM, turn that connection off and on again to reset it. Your virtual machine is now accessible from other PC's on your network.\n\tIf your computer is connected wirelessly, however, the simple \"change to bridged\" change does not work! A few other things have to be configured as outlined in this article: https://windowsreport.com/wifi-error-virtualbox/. The configuration changes require that the VM be shut down and will then only require a minute. Once the VM is rebooted, it will be available on the network.\n\tThe above lets you develop server software on your VM and test it from other computers or use it to interface to IoT devices like the ESP32.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/ESP32": "\nESP32 - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Computers  Software  Hardware  Networking  Internet of Things  \n  Table of contentsESP32ESP32 with Wi-FiGetting the MAC AddressConnecting to Campus WiFi via WPA2Connecting to WiFi via net_regAccessing a RESTful APIUsing WebSocketsUsing MQTTAdditional Resources\nHardwareSerial Communications Not WorkingHardware ResetEagleCAD\nUsing a Virtual Machine as the Server for IoTCommercial Offerings\n\t\nESP32\n\tNOTE the ESP32 interfaces only with 3.3V circuits!\nThese development boards:\n\t\n\thave BOTH wi-fi AND BLE built in. No separate boards are required for networking.\n\t\tare typically about $10 each - far less than a traditional official Arduino Uno.\n\t\tdo NOT have the Uno fornm factor, i.e. they do not directly support the common Arduino shields\n\t\tcan have header pins added and then be plugged into protoboards. Please do NOT solder to one of these boards!\n\t\tare approximately 10x faster than Arduino UNO's\n\t\thave many other valuable features for IoT applications\n\t\tcan also be used for non-IoT applications\n\t\n\tUsing the ESP32 with the Arduino IDE requires first installing the board files.\n\tIn the Arduino IDE, go to File -> Preferences\n\tAdd this in additional board manager URLS: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_dev_index.jsonNOTE - there is an alternate URL pointing to the expressif website to obtain this file. That file may NOT be in sync with the one from github and may be lagging. For example, on 11/30/2021, the JSON from GitHub allowed us to download version 2.0.6 and below of the ESP32 board support while the one from expressif only allowed us to download version 1.0.6. This WILL matter if your goal is to connect to the campus wifi. See below!\n\tNext go to the boards manager.  Search for ESP32. Install the latest version.\n\t\nESP32 with Wi-Fi\n\tNO additional software libraries are required to implement the sample code provided with the ESP32. The board manager installs support for the ESP32 which includes many wifi and web server/HTTP functions. If you are running into issues, be sure to consider removing any additional wifi/HTTP related libraries. The various libraries from the various authors are NOT necessarily compatible with each other and experience to date shows that they are, in fact, NOT compatible! They can and will interfere with each other! To remove a library, you simply delete it from your library folder. There is not an IDE user interface tool for that.\n\tA similar caution applies to the many tutorials and YouTube videos - be sure they are compatible with what you are doing!\n\t\nGetting the MAC Address\n\tRun this code to get the MAC address of the ESP32\n\tBe sure to set the baud rate of your serial monitor to 115200#include \"WiFi.h\" \nvoid setup(){\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n  WiFi.mode(WIFI_MODE_STA);\n  Serial.println(WiFi.macAddress());\n}\nvoid loop(){}\n\t\nConnecting to Campus WiFi via WPA2\n\tThe ESP board support includes network connection examples. Note that the code for connecting to campus will not work for connecting at home and code that works for home will not work on campus!\n\tYou can connect to either the eduroam WiFi network using the \"rcsid@rpi.edu\" format for the identity, or the rpi_wpa2 WiFi network using just the \"rcsid\" as the identify. Both require the use of the certificate method.\nThe Arduino IDE WiFi Tutorial for ESP32: \n\t\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bABHeMea-P0\n\t\thttps://github.com/debsahu/Esp32_EduWiFi\n\t\n\tThe above has been successfully used on campus as of 10/22/2021 BUT required version 1.0.6 of the ESP32 board support (see above). That sample code does NOT work with version 2.0.6 of the ESP32 board support without a few minor changes. These two lines must be changed from  esp_wpa2_config_t config = WPA2_CONFIG_INIT_DEFAULT();\n  esp_wifi_sta_wpa2_ent_enable(&config);\nto// no longer defined in the header\n//  esp_wpa2_config_t config = WPA2_CONFIG_INIT_DEFAULT();\n// the function has been changed to not require / accept a parameter\n//  esp_wifi_sta_wpa2_ent_enable(&config);\n// only need this one line now!\n  esp_wifi_sta_wpa2_ent_enable();\n\tYou may choose to add a #define for the board support version and then place these lines inside a #ifdef / #elseif / #endif block so that a single code base can be shared within / across a  team.\nFor those using the ESP-IDF approach to software development, the following links may be helpful.\n\t\n\tESP-IDF Tutorial (C code): \n\t\n\thttps://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/3e370c4/examples/wifi/wpa2_enterprise\n\t\thttps://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/ESP32-WROOM-32D%20Certificate_WFA77387.pdf\n\t\n\t\n\t\nConnecting to WiFi via net_reg\n\tUSING NET_REG FOR THIS IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY CAMPUS! You must use the above method!\n\tThe most convenient manner of connecting on campus is to use the above method. If you require an alternative, then this method is your only other alternative.\n\tThe following code connects the ESP to the WiFi. For the campus network the password field is left blank. For a home wifi network be sure to use the proper network name and password.\n#include \"WiFi.h\" \nconst char* ssid =\"rpi_netreg\";\nconst char* password = \"\";\nvoid setup() {\n  // put your setup code here, to run once:\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);\n  while(WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED){\n    delay(500);\n    Serial.println(\"Connecting to WiFi..\");\n  }\n  Serial.println(\"Connected to the WiFi network\");\n}\nvoid loop() {\n  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:\n}\n\t\nAccessing a RESTful API\n\tMany IoT applications involve the use of a server with a RESTful API, e.g. Django. This is sample code for using an HTTP GET function for posting to a such a server. Note that depending on the server, you may alternatively need an HTTP POST command. If so, simply use http.POST in the sample below.\nif ((WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED)) { //Check the current connection status\n    HTTPClient http;\n    http.begin(\"http://mdl-vm7.eng.rpi.edu:8080/sensors/1/log?reading=00.02&units=F\");\n    int httpCode = http.GET();        //Make the request. Might need http.POST() instead depending on server.\n    if (httpCode > 0) { //Check for the returning code\n      String payload = http.getString();\n      Serial.println(httpCode);\n      Serial.println(payload);\n    }\n    else {\n      Serial.println(\"Error on HTTP request\");\n      WIFI_ERROR = 1;\n    }\n    http.end(); //Free the resources\n  }\n\t\nUsing WebSockets\n\tThis section needs more content!\n\tTypically people seem to use the ESP8266 library and follow a specific set of instructions to manually modify that, making it work with the ESP32 since they are extremely similar.\n\tThere is apparently a newer sockets library that increases performance and reliability of the connections tho this has not been extensively tested within the Design Lab. There are also suggestions that it may NOT be compatible with some versions of the board manager file, but does work if you change the specific version installed. We do NOT have documentation nor further details at this time. Note that while this may be possibly better, the above one does work.\n\t\nUsing MQTT\n\tThe library EspMQTTClient  has been successfully used to communicate over the MQTT protocol to a virtual machine or other computer running the MQTT broker (also called server\"). Note that an ESP32 that is off campus is unable to communicate to a campus server as support for our VPN is not currently available on the ESP32 platform. For this reason, students should either install the broker on their own computer directly or create a virtual machine on which to run the broker and to perform other software development.\n\tIt is possible to publish or subscribe to MQTT topics from a Python program. This is very helpful for experimenting with the use of MQTT and to confirm that things are working before IoT device development is completed. This requires installation of the mosquitto-clients package.\n\tHere is one site that shows an example Python program for this: http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mosquitto_pub-sub-clients/\n\t\nAdditional Resources\n\tThese are some of the helpful resources for using the ESP32 over wi-fi. There are MANY more available as web pages and YouTube videos!\n\tNote that the HTTPClient library is automatically installed when you add the ESP32 board. Note also that the HttpClient library is NOT the same one and is NOT code compatible! Capitalization is different in the two library names!\n\t\n\thttps://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/\n\t\thttps://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-http-get-post-arduino/\n\t\n\t\n\thttps://robojax.com/learn/arduino/?vid=robojax_ESP32_HTTP_client\n\t\n\t\nHardware\n\t\nSerial Communications Not Working\n\tYou may need to find/download the appropriate driver for your ESP32 development kit. For the SI Labs CP201X interface, this is the driver download page: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers\n\t\nHardware Reset\n\tThis page has instructions to avoid needing to manually press the reset button in order to download updated code to the ESP32: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/solved-failed-to-connect-to-esp32-timed-out-waiting-for-packet-header/\n\tPlease DO NOT solder ANYTHING to the Design Lab ESP32 boards other than header pins! Instead, just add that capacitor to your protoboard! If your loaner board already HAS the capacitor, it was installed by one of the Design Lab staff and should not be removed.\n\t\nEagleCAD\n\tThis website has a library for the Devkitc-v4 version of the board: https://www.snapeda.com/parts/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/Espressif%20Systems/view-part/\n\t\nUsing a Virtual Machine as the Server for IoT\n\tInformation on how to configure your virtual machine to support using it as the server to communicate to the ESP32 can be found on the VirtualBox page.\n\t\nCommercial Offerings\n\tThe ESP32 has proved to be widely accepted and is now being packaged in many configurations beyond the DevKits. A google search will reveal many of these alternatives.\n\t\n\thttps://www.hackster.io/news/m5stack-s-new-industrial-grade-tough-esp32-dev-kit-is-waterproof-and-dustproof-188dd74fb314  10/2021\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Internet_of_Things": "\nInternet of Things - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Computers  Software  Hardware  Networking  \n  \nInternet of Things\n\tThis is sometimes referred to as IoT.\n\t\nProtocols\nA number of different protocols may be used in IoT applications:\n\t\n\tMQTT\n\t\n\thttps://www.machinedesign.com/automation-iiot/article/21137547/mqtt-keeps-iot-system-design-simple\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRESTful API (application programming interface)\n\t\n\tThe lab has implemented a number of successful IoT projects using MQTT or a RESTful API. The Django server platform directly implements a RESTful API. Instructions for building such a server are on the Building a generic Ubuntu LAMP server page.\n\tMore information on these and other aspects of IoT can be found online. This article from Control Engineering covers many of the essential topics:\n\tPLCs_power_industrial_data_integration-IoT.pdf\n\tNote that the assumed \"device\" is a PLC although the ESP32 (see below) can be used in it's place.\n\t\nDevices\n\tSee these pages for more info on specific devices that have been used in the lab.\n\t\nESP32\n\t\nArduino + ESP8266\n\tThe common Arduino devices do not include internet capability. While there are shields available to provide that function, these are intended to work with Arduino's that have the matching headers.\n\tA common and less expensive alternative is to pair the Arduino with an ESP8266. The ESP8266 can be programmed to serve as a \"pass thru wi-fi modem\" which then allows the Arduino to send messages to the internet and receive the responses. Since these are simply strings of characters, no special libraries are needed for basic functions.\n\t\nESP8266\n\tWhile it can be configured in a \"pass-thru mode\" to be used in conjunction with almost any microprocessor, it is also a complete microprocessor on it's own. Due to it's limited configuration in terms of memory and I/O it is only suitable for very small applications. For our Capstone projects it is usually easier to use it in conjunction with a separate microprocessor.\n\tNote that it's a 3.3V device and is NOT compatible with 5V circuits / peripherals.\n\tThe board does NOT include a USB interface, so it cannot be programmed without an external interface. There is information on the web on how to use an Arduino to temporarily provide the interface. The alternative is a dedicated FTDI interface board which the lab does not have.\n\tThe board does not include any edge connectors, only solder pads. The spacing of these pads is NOT compatible with the spacing on a proroboard, adding another inconvenience to using this board.\n\t\nNRF24L01\n\tWhile the ESP8266 chip can connect a microprocessor to wifi, this chip can not! The NRF24L01 device can ONLY be used to talk to another NRF24L01 chip. So it's basically just a radio modem, but is NOT a wifi interface. If you are ordering parts, be careful you do not accidentally select this rather than the ESP8266. It is sometimes incorrectly marketed as an \"Arduino wifi antenna\". These are quite inexpensive, however, if you simply need a modem for remote operation. You might, however, then also need something to \"bridge\" between the NRF24L01 and the rest of your system.\n\t\nCypress PSoC4BLE\n\tThis flexible \"Programmable System on a Chip\" has built in BLE capabilities. An interesting feature of this chip is that the I/O pins are configurable, such that a given pin may be set as either a digital I/O or an analog I/O. It has a hybrid programming environment that combines the typical C language programming as used in LITEC with a powerful schematic mode where logic and function blocks are added to a schematic. The C program can access data within the schematic! The chip can also be programmed in VHDL. While the C/schematic mode can be challenging to take advantage of, it does offer capabilities not found in other microprocessors.\n\tWhile the chip does not include wifi, it is possible to add an ESP8266 to provide that capability.\n\t\nCypress PSoc6 Family\n\tThis is an even more powerful model of PSoC. Two versions are available - one with BLE and the other with both BLE and WiFi. The processor is a dual CPU ARM device providing for a very large amount of programming / processing capabilities.\n\tCypress altered their programming approach from the PSoC 1-5 families and the PSoC family is only available for C based programming - no schematic mode exists.\n\tThe programming is on the high end of challenging for most students. As a result, although the device is extremely capable, this family is not recommended for Capstone projects.\n\t\nPLC\n\tA PLC is a programmable logic controller. These are ruggedized devices that have been used on the factory floor & in other industry applications for decades.

The menu should contain the item \"rpi_802.1x\" (if the wireless radio is enabled, and scanning for Access Points, there should be something there.  If not, solve this problem first, or enter the rest manually.*\n\t*manually, under connection editor's \"wireless\" tab, enter the SSID  \"rpi_802.1x\", mode is \"Infrastructure\", leave BSSID and MAC fields blank, leave MTU set at \"automatic\".\n\t4. In the connection editor window, Choose the \"wireless security\" tab.  When asked for the security type, chose \"Dynamic WEP\". The rest of the menu items will then appear.  In the Authentication dropdown menu, choose \"Protected EAP (PEAP)\".  Leave the \"Anonymous Identity\" field blank.  Leave the other settings as they are (CA Certificate = None, PEAP version = Automatic, Inner Authentication = MSCHAPv2).\n\t5. Enter your RCSID (if your email address is \"goodwc3@rpi.edu\", your RCSID is \"goodwc3\", for example) in the  \"User Name\" Field.  Enter your RCS password (the one you use for your RPI email and everything else) in the \"password\" field.\n\t6. Click Apply.

Cordova is a mobile application development framework. It extends the features of HTML and JavaScript to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile application (because all layout rendering is done via Web views instead of the platform's native UI framework) nor purely Web-based (because they are not just Web apps, but are packaged as apps for distribution and have access to native device APIs).\n\t\niOS Development Set-Up\n\tIn order for a cross platform iOS app to be created it needs to have and environment which supports HTML, JavaScript development which ideally has a visualizer ( Monaca IDE ). In order to seamlessly connect to SVN from Monaca you need to download Visual Studio Community . When building on a Windows Operating systems a service is required to build the files to a stand-alone application ( *PhoneGap Build * ). In order to test the development with the web server you need to create a local instance of the web server (see other wiki). Follow these steps to set up local development\n\t\nMonaca IDE\n\tMonaca is an online IDE which allows hybrid mobile app development process with PhoneGap/Cordova. In order to seamlessly port the working code to SVN you need to use the free extension from Monaca for Visual Studio 2015 Community.

Log in to your Monaca and selection iOSDevelopment project.\n\t\tCheck the files system to ensure that the config.xml files does not have any changes (it would have a red exclamation point) If so revert the changes. All the folder in this project is not added to the ignore list for the commit for SVN so only the file  in www folder  and config.xml will have the svn gree checkmarks.\n\t\tSave the Visual Studio Project again to  updated the changes to the config. \n\t\tCheck in Monaca that your changes have been made to look like your local copy.\n\t\tDelete the renamed iOS development folder.\n\t\n\t\nBuilding Standalone App with PhoneGap Build\n\t\nWhat is PhoneGap Build?\nPhoneGap Build allows for cross platform builds. They will do the work in the cloud and will be built with the most up-to-date SDK for target platform. With out additional certificates Android and Windows Apps can be created. \n\t\n\tLog on PhoneGap Build using the free trial of build (allows for one private app)\n\t\n\t\niOS Development Certificate using Windows\nIn order to development in iOS a development certificate is required which costs $99 per year for one developer for one test device. The account which was used was Junichi's (email account: kanaij@rpi.edu and pswd: recieve upon request)\n\t\n\tFirst you need to download the Win64 OpenSSL v1.0.2d Light here - http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html\n\t\tIn order to create a iOS development certificate without an mac you need to create a .csr file. \n\t\tWithin the bin folder of OpenSSL run the following cmd prompt. You will be prompted to input a password. Keep it in the range of 4-1023 characters and remember this password you will be using it to sign other certificates. OpenSSL command line app does not display any characters when you are entering your password. Just type it then press enter and you will see that it is working.openssl genrsa -des3 -out ios.key 2048\n\t\n\t\n\tThen run the following replacing email, company name and country codeopenssl req -new -key ios.key -out ios.csr -subj \"/emailAddress=MY-EMAIL-ADDRESS, CN=COMPANY-NAME, C=COUNTRY-CODE\"I chose\"/emailAddress=kanaij@rpi.edu, CN=AGS, C=USA\" \n\t\tLog on to https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/\n\t\tClick on Certificates Identifiers & Profiles and then the + to request a cert, selecting iOS development option. \n\t\tUse the .csr file which was just created to continue creating the certificate.\n\t\tDownload the .cer file and place in the bin folder of OpenSSL\n\t\n\t\nConvert an Apple developer certificate to a P12 file\n\t\n\tTo develop apps via PhoneGap Build, you must use a P12 certificate file. You generate this certificate based on the .cer Apple iPhone developer certificate file you receive from Apple.\n\t\tIt is possible to create several certificates\n\t\tConvert the developer certificate file you receive from Apple into a PEM certificate file. To do this, run the following command-line statement from the OpenSSL bin directory:openssl x509 -in ios.cer -inform DER -out ios.pem -outform PEM\n\t\tYou can now generate a valid P12 file, based on the key and the PEM version of the iPhone developer certificate:openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey ios.key -in ios.pem -out ios.p12\n\t\tIt will prompt you for your ios.key password, enter what you entered to create the key file\n\t\tIt will prompt you to create an Export Password which is a pass phrase source to encrypt any outputted private keys.\n\t\n\t\nRegister devices\n\t\n\tVisit Apple Developer Portal.\n\t\tGo to Device section. Under Manage tab, provide Device Name and Device ID (40 hex characters)You will need to get your UDID by plugging your phone into itunesIn the right pane, locate the information about your iPhone, including its name, capacity, software version, serial number, and phone number.Reveal the Identifier by clicking on Serial Number.Copy the Identifier to your clipboard by choosing Edit  Copy\n\t\n\t\nCreate Apple Development Provisioning Profile\n\t\n\tVisit Apple Developer Portal.\n\t\tGo to Provisioning section. Create new profile under Development tab.\n\t\tFill the form with Profile Name, Certificates (as per .cer above), App ID and your development device.\n\t\n\tthe details here should match YOUR team's info\n\tName: <username>App ID Prefix: <Team ID>Explicit App ID; Bundle ID : com.<appname>.<team>\n\t\nSubmit to Build\n\t\n\tGo to your Account > Edit Setting > Signing Keys' tab\n\t\n\t\nAdding certificates\n\t\n\tUpload the Development Provision cert and .p12 file with the same password you were using.\n\t\n\t\nRunning a Build\n\t1.    Login to PhoneGap Build (with free Adobe account)2.    Add iOS certificates (see iOS development wiki for details)3.    Downloaded the Project from Monaca File>Export Project4.    Unzipped the folder5.    Deleted .monaca , platforms folder and in www folder delete components folder6.    moved config.xml to www folder7.    added <script src=\"cordova.js\"></script> to every html file 8.    deleted from every html file these two lines        <script src=\"components/loader.js\"></script>\n       <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"components/loader.css\">\n9.    added all plugin  the app required to config.xml. You need to check if  the version is correct when you are pulling from either pgb (PhoneGap Build) or npm.<plugin name=\"org.apache.cordova.vibration\" spec=\"0.3.0\" source=\"pgb\" />\n10.    zipped it up the file11.    uploaded to PhoneGap  Build12.    use the QR code scanner to download to iPhone\n\t\nAccessing and Storing Accelerator\n\t\nAccessing Accelerator Data\n\tThe PhoneGap API accesses the accelerometor data on the phone. The object navigator.accelerometer is how the data is captured. The function accelerometer.getCurrentAcceleration get the current acceleration. iOS doesn't recognize the concept of getting the current acceleration at any given point. You must watch the acceleration and capture the data at given time intervals. The getCurrentAcceleration function yields the last value reported from a watchAccelerometer call.\n\t\nPseudo Code to read Accelerometor\nif the accelerometer watch is off\n  update the accelerometer to 0,0,0\n  clear the watch\nelse\n  set the frequency to the values of ms\n  update the acceleration data\n     alert if failed\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Doxygen": "\nDoxygen - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Computers  Software  Hardware  Networking  \n  \nDoxygen\n\tdoxygen is an open source program that creates software documentations in HTML, RTF, and LaTex from the marked comments in source files.

The new WPA style might be 'out of the box' compatible but this has not been verified yet. The procedure below is needed to access the 802.1x network which is still used in some areas on campus.\n\t(used successfully with Asus TF101 running Android 3.1)1.

The vendor id was determined using the \"lsusb\" command in the terminal.\n\tnote 2: under ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid), the mtpfs package must be compiled from source (the packaged distribution is  broken, for some reason.  go here to get the source: http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/lucid/mtpfs\n\t\nHelper Application Launch Issue under Honeycomb 3.2\n\tFrom the note found here:http://www.gkspk.com/view/info/issues-in-android-honeycomb-3-2/\n\tText follows:\n\tIssues in Android 3.2Sunday, 24th July 2011 by Musaul Karim\n\tAndroid 3.2 finally provides external storage support in actual android code, so the manufacturers dont need to patch it in. However, it is currently just read-only. That seems to have dissapointed a few people.\n\tOne of the biggest niggles however in Android 3.2 is they introduced a bug in intents. Its the mechanism how one activity launches another one. If there are multiple apps installed which can handle an activity (ex: if you have multiple image viewer apps), android gives you a window where you can pick which app you want to use. This bug prevents the picker window from coming up properly. Instead, the screen just darkens a little. The workaround is to rotate the device which will cause the window to come up.\n\tThe bug is officially documented & described here:http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=18638&q=label%3AVersion-3.0&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars\n\tHence, rotate the screen to bring up the helper application selection menu.  If the tablet is in the keyboard/dock, it must be removed from the dock to rotate the display, after which the tablet can be returned to the dock. (this took me a little while to figure out --casey)\n\t\nUsing the Exchange Server for Email\n\tThe following settings were derived from the information at the Help Desk web pages -- Mark\n\t\nIncoming Settings\nIMAP server - exchange.rpi.edu\nSecurity type - SSL/TLS\nPort - 993\n\t\nOutgoing Settings\nSMTP server - exchange.rpi.edu\nSecurity type - STARTTLS\nPort - 587\nRequire sign-in - IS checked, then enter your RCSID/password\n\tCheck the \"Automatically download attachments when on WiFi\" if you want that.\n\t\nUsing the Built-In Calendar Function\n\tIf you are syncing to external accounts, ex: Google for application backup and/or email, then the Android will show you two calendars. One will be your Google calendar. The other is the built in calendar bearing the name ASUS.\n\tItems in the ASUS calendar can/will be synced to Outlook by using the ASUS Sync program. Items from your Google/other calendars will NOT be synced to Outlook. Creating items in any other calendar other than the ASUS one will leave you with items that don't and can't appear in Outlook. This may be mis-interpreted as a sync error when in fact all is working as designed, just not as intended! To \"fix\" the broken syncing, items have to be moved to the ASUS calender.\n\tUnfortunately, the Android calendar has no tool to let you change the assigned calender for a given event! A third party app called Business Calendar has a free version that WILL let you do this. Each event must be opened in turn and the calendar changed manually. Once this has been done, the tablet can be synced to Outlook and these items should now be present in the Outlook calendar.\n\tIf you are not using any of the other calendars, you can avoid entering data into the wrong calendar by de-selecting all calendars other than the ASUS one. This will hide any events stored in those calendars. If you need the other calendars then you'll simply have to pay attention to which calendar is set before saving the event OR using the Business Calendar app to change it afterwards.\n\tThe Business Calendar app seems to be friendly and nice looking with multiple widgets suitable for the tablet's home pages. It is possible to use that instead of the default Android calendar app.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Raspberry_Pi": "\nRaspberry Pi - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Technology Related  \n  Table of contentsRaspberry PiConnecting to RPi 3 to RPI WiFiConnecting to HDMI TV'sUsing VNC to Access the RPiDisplaying your PC screen on the PiOn the PiScreensaverVNC Viewer\nOn the PCVNC Server\nDisplaying the Pi on your PCChanged to Fixed IPAccessing the Campus VPN NetworkInstall vpncUpdate the ConfigurationAccessing the VPN\n\t\nRaspberry Pi\n\tA collection of helpful information on using / applying the Raspberry Pi!\n\t\nConnecting to RPi 3 to RPI WiFi\n\t Add following lines to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf Use tab instead of space Ensure theres NO space at the end of each line Use an RCS account for identity and password.

First, the Pi runs a vncviewer in listen mode. Second, the PC runs a vncserver that can push a connection to a viewer.\n\t\nOn the Pi\n\t\nScreensaver\n\tDisable the screen saver / screen blanking by alterning the lightdm configiuration as found on this website: http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/2059/disable-screen-blanking-in-x-windows-on-raspbian\n\tEdit /etc/lightdm/lightdb.conf and add the following line to the [SeatDefaults] section:\nxserver-command=X -s 0 -dpms\n\t\nVNC Viewer\n\tInstall a vncviewer:\nsudo apt-get install xtightvncviewer\n\tBased on information found at http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=43473 , put the following shell script in a file which we shall call start-viewer.sh (note that I did not bother to make it a one liner):\n#!/bin/sh\nexport DISPLAY :0.0\nxtightvncviewer -listen\n\tand make it executable:\nchmod +x start-viewer.sh\n\tThen, you must enable others to access the 0 display:\nxhost +\n\tIf xhost is not already installed you will need to do:\n# intsall xhost\nsudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils\n\tThen you need to run xhost so that all nodes can get in - yes this is NOT secure!\nxhost +\n\tNote that this provides the most unsecured access! Experiment with xhost to narrow down the range of those who can output to the main X window display (screen 0).\n\tBy executing the following command, the vncviewer will be started and left running and will return control back to the terminal:nohup ./start-viewer.sh &\n\tI recommend placing this in an 'autostart' file so that the vncviewer is started every time the Pi boots and the LXDE display manager starts up. This was found at: http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=11256\n*Create the folder home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE*In this folder put a file named autostart containing one line specifying the full path of the file to be executed:\n\t\n\t/home/pi/start-viewer.sh*Make the autostart file executable by using the properties menu in the File Manager to alter the permissions on the file or use:\n\t\tchmod +x home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart\n\t\n\tNext time you reboot the vncviewer will automatically get started!\n\tAt this point, the Pi is ready to display a screen from whoever connects to it! If the above command is added to the startup scripts then it will automatically get launched when the Pi boots. alternatively, you can SSH into the Pi and run that command to start the viewer.\n\tIt has been noted that connecting to the vncviewer does NOT cause the screensaver to 'wake up' so for this application it appears that it should be disabled.\n\t\nOn the PC\n\t\nVNC Server\n\tThe PC now needs a vncserver (NOT a vncviewer) that can connect to an existing listener. I have used tightvnc successfully for several years (on XP, Vista and now windows 7) and so I can recommend it. Download and install it from: http://www.tightvnc.com\n\tOnce installed, simply run the vncserver. It will place an icon in the system tray. Right click on that and choose \"Attach Listening Viewer\" and when prompted, provide the name or IP address of the node hosting the viewer, in this case the Pi. At this point your PC screen should be visible on the Pi's display. Note that if the Pi is running 1920x1080 then it may be 'larger' that your PC's display. If you run a two monitor setup on the PC, part of the second monitor's output may show up on the Pi. simply move that off screen if needed.\n\tWhen you are done screen sharing, simply right click on the vncserver and choose \"Disconnect all viewers\" which will drop the connection.\n\tIn this configuration, many PC users may connect to the same Raspberry Pi without making any changes to the Pi. ONLY one PC can connect at a time.\n\t\nDisplaying the Pi on your PC\n\tThis is a standard Linux technique and is not unique to the Pi. On the Pi, you need a vncserver. One was already installed on the Wheezy distribution. If needed, you may install the tightvnc pages by using a terminal window and running:\nsudo apt-get install tightvncserver\n\tOnce it's installed, run the following to start the server on display 1:\ntightvncserver :1\n\tIt will prompt for a password for full access and a second one for read-only access. This starts the server with the default geometry of 1024x768.\n\tYou may also start multiple vncservers. For example, I can start a second server on display 2 with a higher resolution to match my PC's monitor resolution using:tightvncserver :2 -geometry 1650x1050\n\tDoing this leaves a server running for my high resolution PC access and a default one in case I connect from some other device / PC (like an Android tablet).\n\t\nChanged to Fixed IP\n\tThe default for most Lijux systems including the Pi is to come up with a dynamically assigned IP address using DHCP. When using the Pi as a server, it may be more appropriate to use a fixed IP address.\n\tNOTE - the fixed IP shown here is already assigned to Mark Anderson (see the assignment list on Virtual Machines. You will need to obtain a new/different address for your use.\n\tUse your favorite editor or nano to edit /etc/network/interfaces. You must do this as superuser, so do this to make the edits:sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\tAnd comment out this line:iface eth0 inet dhcp\n\tand replace it with:\n# Your NAME and DATE HERE - always comment your changes!\n#iface eth0 inet dhcp\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 128.113.216.67\nnetmask 255.255.252.0\nbroadcast 128.113.219.255\ngateway 128.113.219.254\n\t\nAccessing the Campus VPN Network\n\tThis does NOT work yet - BUT the correct approach is to install the vpnc client.\n\t\nInstall vpnc\nsudo apt-get install vpnc\n\t\nUpdate the Configuration\n\tYou'll need to edit the config file located in /etc/vpnc/default.conf OR COPY it to /etc/vpnc/rpi.confsudo cp /etc/vpnc/default.conf /etc/vpnc/rpi.conf\n\tIn that file, you'll need to un-commment some lines and add make changes to a few as shown below.

Developers should still place the entire project folder under version control within a subversion repository.\n\tCreate a folder for the Quartus designs. Then create a separate sub-folder for each project. This helps keep the files from different projects organized and separated. If multiple projects are placed in the same folder there could be file name collisions.\n\t\nTips\n\tDISCLAIMER - These are based primarily on Mark Anderson's personal observations in working with the device.\n\tIf programming in Verilog, the module name MUST be the same as the file name.\nThe USB Blaster will only exist if:\n\t\n\tthe DE2-115 is plugged into a PC's USB port\n\t\tthe other end of the USB cable is plugged into the proper port on the DE2-115 - the Blaster port\n\t\tthe DE2-115 is turned on\n\t\n\tAfter compiling an updated version of an application, re-launch the programmer from the Quartus window. It does not appear that the programmer will take the new version of the download file unless this is done.\n\tIf you get a lot of pin assignment errors and/or the SOF file won't download to the DE2-115, check that the correct device was selected. For the DE2-115 this is the EP4CE115F29C7.\n\tIf you copy & paste items in the schematic method of data entry, the software will create identical \"instance\" names and thus not compile your application. You need to edit each copied item (chip, GND, etc.) and change that instance name to be unique.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Logitech_Fusion_Camera": "\nLogitech Fusion Camera - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Technology Related  \n  \nLogitech Fusion Camera\n\tThis method worked with PC running Ubuntu 10.04 having Logitech QuickCam: Fusion: http://indiangeek.com/blog/?p=60\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/RC_Servo_Systems": "\nRC Servo Systems - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Technology Related  \n  \nRC Servo Systems\n\t\n\thttp://home.roboticlab.eu/en/examples/motor/servo - Link explaining how RC servo (positioning) systems work\n\t\thttp://www.luolamies.org/misc/servo.html - controlling RC systems\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Motors_and_Drives": "\nMotors and Drives - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Technology Related  \n  \nMotors and Drives\n\tHelpful information related to motors and drives.\n\t\nLinks\n\t\n\thttp://www.reliance.com/mtr/mtrthrmn.htm - basic AC/DC motor operation.

It is supposed to work on Windows and Lunix but Mark Anderson has only used it on Ubuntu. On the Ubuntu platform it was included up to the 12.04 release at which point the Ubuntu team dropped it. The source for the final version (1.1) was still available at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/+source/harpia as of 4/1/2015.\n\tHarpia is a Python program and provides a GUI for experimenting with image processing. It generates C code that calls OpenCV to do the actual processing.\n\tAs there is no suitable packaged release, Harpia must be installed and the dependencies resolved manually.\n\t\nUbuntu 12.04\n\tOn this platform, Mark Anderson was able to perform an installation with these steps. The package is NOT tested / verified in this environment and may still not work completely / correctly.\n\t\nAssumptions\n\t\n\tOpenCV has already been installed and is working\n\t\tthe gcc compiler and related build tools are already installed\n\t\tPython >=2.6 is installed\n\t\n\t\nInstallation Steps\n\t\n\tDownload the source\n\t\textract to a folder\n\t\tfollow instructions in the readme file, basically: sudo python setup.py - this builds and installs the Harpia software ONLY!\n\t\tThere will likely be a missing dependency for 4Suite-XML. Try to install this using \"sudo pip search 4Suite-XML\" \n\t\n\tThis will probably fail! \n\t\tFind the folder where the package was downloaded and cd into that. For me, this was: cd build/4Suite-XML\n\t\tsudo python setup.py install\n\t\tThis should complete ok and finish installing the package\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHarpia was build to look for files in a particular location which has now changed. Solve this by simply adding symbolic link:\n\t\n\t# files used to be in /user/share/harpia and are NOW in /usr/local/share/harpia\n\t\tsudo ln -s /usr/local/share/harpia /usr/share/harpia\n\t\n\t\n\tAt this point, Harpia can be launched using the command 'harpia'. The GUI should open. The installation can be verified by trying the examples ( on the menu, Help -> Examples).\n\t\nUbuntu 14.04\n\tIt is optimistic but untested that following the Ubuntu 12.04 steps will work on 14.04 with the same assumptions in place.\n\tChanges to OpenCV may cause the compiling / linking operations to change over time. In fact the only changes from version 1 to 1.1 were adjustments to the Makefile that harpia generates. Python 3 may potentially require many changes and are not addressed here.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Sensors": "\nSensors - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Technology Related  \n  Table of contentsSensorsTekscan force sensorsLVDT\n\t\nSensors\n\t\nTekscan force sensors\n\t\n\tTekscan / Flexiforce Sensors\n\t\n\t\nLVDT\n\t\n\tMachine Design - Leaders in OEM - 2015 - LVDT Terminology.pdf - helpful in learning about LVDT's (linear variable differential transformers)\n\t\n\tAttachments\n  Files (1)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Machine Design - Leaders in OEM - 2015 - LVDT Terminology.pdf    (720 KB)\n    Machine Design - Leaders in OEM - 2015 - LVDT Terminology.pdf  \n  article from Machine Design\n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2016-01-13 11:21 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Tekscan": "\nTekscan - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Technology Related  \n  \nTekscan / Flexiforce Sensors\n\tThese are small inexpensive resistive pressure / force sensors.\n\t\nTekscan System\n\tTekscan sells \"handles\" which are actually a complete interface for a single sensor. Testing showed that with 4 handles (sensors) feeding a powered USB hub, the \"fourth\" sensor did not show a reading on the strip chart even though all 4 sensors showed up in the list of connected devices within the TekScan MELF software.\n\tWORKAROUND\n\t\n\tOpen the first strip chart. Note that the problem sensor is \"found\" but no data is showing.\n\t\tLeave that chart open.\n\t\tOpen a second chart. Note that all four sensors now display data.\n\t\n\tProblem apparently somewhere in the Tekscan USB driver or in the MELF software itself.\n\t\nFlexiforce Sensors\n\tThe sensors alone can be interfaced to a standard analog input module (DAQ/micro/Labjack/etc.) using a simple op amp interface circuit ( MC34071-D.pdf ). Note that this will be FAR more economical than purchasing the Tekscan interface electronics. The challenge, however, is to create a solid reliable physical/electrical interface between the sensors and your circuit. Do NOT solder to the terminals as you can/probably will melt the plastic. Instead look for a terminal strip with the proper spacing so that the wires can be inserted and the screws tightened for a good physical and electrical connection.\n  Files (2)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    MC34071-D.pdf    (297 KB)\n    MC34071-D.pdf  \n  Tekscan documentation\n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2011-06-01 11:12 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    FLX-Flexiforce-Calibration-QuickStart.pdf    (87.3 KB)\n    FLX-Flexiforce-Calibration-QuickStart.pdf  \n  Conditioning (before use) and calibration\n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2014-08-19 10:25 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Local_and_Suggested_Vendors": "\nLocal and Suggested Vendors - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nPurchasing Guidelines  \n  \nLocal and Suggested Vendors\n\tThe internet is chock full of places to buy things.

Our goal is, as quickly as possible, to approve purchases that will be appropriate for your project! This is what you should expect to see at your future jobs whether in industry or academia! (you may have already seen it in clubs and Greek organizations.)\n\t\nCustomer Needs\n\tThe purpose of defining customer needs is so that we can determine the multiple technically based project requirements that are needed to meet those customer needs.\n\t\nProject Requirements\n\tFrom the technically defined project requirements, we create multiple concepts for addressing those. We can then establish the criteria needed to make or buy key project components.\n\t\nApproval Review\n\tWhen we are asked to approve any purchase, we do so only after looking at the proposed concept and the requirements it is intended to address. Only then can we begin to determine if the proposed purchase is the appropriate one! Please note that urgency is rarely a criteria used for approving purchases!\n\tPlease note:\n\tTeams need more than just a concept! Teams need a concrete design documented that fully shows how the items will be used (schematic, CAD, etc.) as well as supporting analysis showing how/why the item will work within the overall system. In terms of the design process, this usually means passing through concept generation and selection and getting into detailed design - before ordering parts, especially expensive ones.\n\tIn general, we do not need to purchase parts to see \"if they work\". Commercial parts are sold to meet their manufacturer's specs. We also do not generally order parts to see \"if or how easily they can be integrated\". Instead we use the available data sheet information for this.\nSome things that we normally catch during this review:\n\t\n\taccidentally ordering surface mount components when through-hole ones are to be used with a protoboard\n\t\tbuying actuating components like motors and relays that exceed the current or voltage capabilities of the electronics that were expected to drive them\n\t\tbuying actuators whose size or shape is dramatically different than needed\n\t\tordering parts that also need special mounting components which were not included in the purchase request\n\t\tnot buying enough or buying too many items for a variety of reasons. For components that are likely to get damaged through use or accident, we might need to order extras / spares. We evaluate remaining time in the semester, shipping delays and costs vs. the cost of the spares!\n\t\tfailing to follow the special process needed for all chemical orders.\n\t\n\tTo save time, money, and frustration all around, the Project Engineers all perform this review as part of the approval process. Our only goal is to help you get the right parts that your team can actually use to move your project forward. We do this based on the design process artifacts that are taught in IED and then used in Capstone, and more importantly, later in most of your careers.\n\t\nRelated Pages\n\t\n\tCAD Templates\n\t\tDiagrams and CAD\n\t\n\t\nFabrication\nAfter the above, follow the process outlined on the Capstone Support wiki for creating:\n\t\n\tParts machined/created by student team - Self Fabricated Part Process\n\t\tParts machined/created by RPI staff - Shop Fabricated Part Process\n\t\tParts created through rapid prototyping - Rapid Prototyped Part Process\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/CAD_Templates": "\nCAD templates - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nManufacturing Resources  \n  \nCAD templates\n\tSelect the appropriate file based on your CAD package.\n\tFind the most recent templates for NX and SolidWorks posted at the CAD Homepage:https://afsws.rpi.edu/AFS/dept/eng/cax/cad/templates/\n\tUnzip the files, review the README file, and place in appropriate locations.\n\tPlease read and follow the README file for instructions.

Schedule an office appointment with your Project Engineer for this review. In general, for final approval, hard copy drawings are required. Preliminary discussions may be done with the model in CAD.\n\tThis diagram shows the general process:\nNote that the computer aided drafting (both electrical and mechanical) will be reviewed for MANY things including:\n\t\n\twill it work?\n\t\twill it provide the intended functionality?\n\t\twill it properly mate / interface to other components in the system either internal or external?\n\t\thow / can it be fabricated?\n\t\tis the equipment capable of producing the desired part(s)?\n\t\twhat is the lead time - will it be available in time?\n\t\twhat is the estimated cost?\n\t\tdo the drawings follow established standards?\n\t\n\tMore information about creating the required diagrams and documentation can be found in the following sections.\n\t\nSystem Diagrams for Electrical Work\n\tIt is important to create documentation for the individual circuits within a project as well as an interconnection or system level diagram to explain how the pieces go together. The attached scanned pages ( engineering-design-pages.pdf ) provide some drafting samples from a textbook, \"Engineering Design for Electrical Engineers\". This is NOT a template for any reports / memos - just a sample of some typical schematics.\n\tThese are not meant as definitive tutorials, only as samples of drawings from the industry.\n\t\nP&ID Diagrams\n\tThese are typically created as DWG format documents. A lightweight, free application \"DRAFTSIGHT\" can be used to create, edit, and view pure 2D DWG files. The link for this is below:http://www.3ds.com/products/draftsight/free-cad-software/\n\tNX, Bentley Microstation, and AutoCAD can also be used to create these.If you have any questions, please contact Jeff Morris - morrij5@rpi.edu\n\t\nHydraulic/Pneumatic Diagrams\n\tThese are typically created using custom software, akin to CAD packages for mechanical part/assembly documentation.For Capstone use, a PowerPoint slide can be used to describe connections and flows.Be sure to use the industry standard symbols for components within the system. Both to get students accustomed to them, and so that when someone in the industry finally looks at them, it makes sense to them.A document with typical components in Micrsoft Word format can be found here - http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Hydraulic_Symbol_Library\n\tPneuDraw is a simple free software package to draw pneumatic circuits -  https://www.smc.eu/en-eu/products/engineering-tools/pneumatic_circuits_drawing\n\t\nSimple (2D) Diagram Creation\nAs the standard laptop software kit includes PowerPoint, most students may elect to use that to draw diagrams. Alternatives include:\n\t\n\tSolidworks - overkill for simple 2D diagramming but widely used on campus.\n\t\tNX - overkill for simple 2D diagramming but widely used on campus.\n\t\nThe following are NOT acceptable for the indicated reasoning:\n\t\n\tBentley MicroStation - once but not currently part of the standard Laptop software load\n\t\tDO NOT USE Visio - Microsoft's specific package for this purpose - NOT part of the standard RPI core load - please DO NOT USE\n\t\tDO NOT USE Dia - OpenSource package for most platforms (Win/Linux, but unknown for Mac). http://live.gnome.org/Dia [Note - cannot rotate objects!] - please DO NO USE\n\t\tDO NOT USE Microsoft Paint is NOT an acceptable method of image creation or modification\n\t\tDO NOT USE any AutoCAD product including Inventor - Do NOT use as this is NOT widely used on our campus at this time. People who already have either of the campus standard packages (NX / Solidworks) do not want/need to install yet another package. We are looking for maximum compatibility from semester to semester.\n\t\tDO NOT USE Illustrator - An excellent product from Adobe but unfortunately NOT (readily / freely) available to everyone. \n\t\tvarious Linux only alternatives - all interesting, but forces everyone on a team to migrate to Linux just to see/edit your drawings. Do NOT use these.\n\t\tDO NOT USE Draw.io or ANY web based software tools - these do not run within RPI's computing space and may allow intellectual property to be accidentally released. These are often 'specialty' tools, meaning that not everyone on the team, including your PE and CE, has necessarily used the tool and would require access & traiing.\n\t\n\tStick to the standard RPI issued software.\n\tOutput files should be in a format readable by the standard programs we uses, i.e. Microsoft Office. For example, image files should be JPG, PNG or GIF format.\n\t\nMechanical 3D Drawings\n\tUse only one of the two campus standards - NX or Solidworks for the project. If your project is an ongoing one, please use the same CAD package as the previous team(s). Check with your team & Project Engineer to see which version should be used. Please DO NOT use any AutoCAD product including Inventor as this is not widely used on our campus at this time. People who already have either of the campus standard packages (NX / Solidworks) do not want/need to install yet another package. We are looking for maximum compatibility from semester to semester. The only exception would be if your sponsor requires an AutoCAD product. If so, then consult your Project Engineer.\n\tAny assemblies designed or to be fabricated by the team should be represented in a complete physical drawing package.  These prints may be handed over to machinists here on campus, made by students within the team, or sent off to outside vendors for fabrication.  It is vital that packages are complete and free of ambiguity, to prevent mistakes and speed production.  Leaving off a dimension may cause multiple days of delay as the question makes it to the team, and then the answer goes back to the fabricator. Assembly drawings also communicate your design to your sponsor and to future teams.\n\tApply as much foresight as possible, and design the technical drawing packet with the perspective of an outside viewer and far more importantly, the machinist in mind. Using existing drawing standards, ex: ANSI, helps with this communication. Having the design formulated in ones mind, it is most common to exclude details/ reasoning that might otherwise be absolutely vital in understanding and visualizing the design at hand.\n\tBecause we are in the United States, commonly available hardware and materials are \"imperial\", i.e. in inches rather than metric. Unless specifically required by your sponsor, DO NOT use metric dimensions, metric hardware, or metric raw material in your design. This will only increase cost and complexity of fabrication.\nThe following is a partial checklist for full drawing packages:[review your drawings against the Capstone Drawing Guidelines to ensure completeness. - Excel or PDF]\n\t\n\tUse the standard RPI B sized template. Do NOT alter the tolerance block unless you are making a metric drawing. - CAD_templates\n\t\tCover sheet with isometric assembly view\n\t\n\tThis must be complete, including parts of the assembly that might not necessarily have to be fabricated, but must be shown in order to display the manner in which the entire assembly comes together (how various parts relate to each other). Others may use this to assemble your device.\n\t\tThis drawing page should also include an (smaller) isometric image of the completed assembly to offer a very complete picture of the assembly.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBill of Materials (BOM) - template posted here - Templates and Forms\n\t\n\tPart Number - same as file name. This MUST be consistent throughout the entire drawing packet, i.e. there should NOT be multiple things numbered as \"part 1\".\n\t\tPart Name (also consistent with the title of each part drawing)\n\t\tDescription (does not have to contain fabricating details, including dimension or material, that would hinder/conflict with any changes that might be necessary)\n\t\tQuantity\n\t\tRequired hardware (English units unless customer requires metric. For fabrication, convert to English for fabrication, except for metric specific parts)\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSheet for each fabricated component with orthogonal and isometric views\n\t\n\tCross sections as appropriate\n\t\tUseful descriptive part names\n\t\tMaterial\n\t\tItem number from BOM\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRational / reasonable dimensions and tolerances based on cost and manufacturing method\n\t\n\tEach part drawing must contain all necessary dimensions that are required to allow the machinist to fabricate the part accurately. \n\t\tThe dimensions should use the least number of decimal points possible in order to reduce the fabrication accuracy (translating to cost) of the part. Avoid having too many significant figures!\n\t\tThere must be comprehensive and clear notes where necessary. These notes are messages to the machinist to clarify/specify fabricating instructions and/or special requirements/ treatments etc. that might be required for the specific part.\n\t\tThe entire drawing page must include all necessary views, to allow the machinist or anyone viewing the document to fully comprehend and visualize the part with ease and assurance. The views typically used are Front, Top/Bottom and Left/Right. A scaled down (not necessary to mention scale) isometric view of the part is also, always helpful.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe title block must be present in any and all technical drawings. The information MUST be accurate and up-to-date. The title block must be as complete as possible and provide all information not covered by the drawing itself.\n\t\tReferencing of parts and assemblies throughout the drawing packet MUST be simple and consistent.\n\t\tMaterials:\n\t\n\tFor most common materials such as aluminum (6061, 6063, 3000, 7075), carbon steel (cold or hot rolled), and stainless steel (304 or 316) in simple shapes such as bars, plates, and rods - specify the acceptable materials and let the shop take care of procuring. \n\t\tFor special material such as special temper or alloy aluminum, composites, unusual alloys, specialty plastics, or special shapes that ease manufacturing, your Project Engineer will sign off on a material purchase. Please indicate in the notes section of the paper CAD drawing the material part number and order date when such special materials are ordered\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tFinal steps - follow the documented capstone process for procurement\n\t\n\tSelf Fabricated Part Process\n\t\tShop Fabricated Part Process\n\t\tRapid Prototyped Part Process\n\t\tPurchasing Process\n\t\n\t\n\t\nExample Capstone Drawing Package\n\tA past student Capstone project is presented as an example of a complete drawing package.  This package is good, though by no means perfect. It is annotated with explanations of what is present, and corrections of some common issues. ( Example_Capstone_Drawing_Package_V2.0.pptx )\n\tCAD Templates are available for both NX and SolidWorks with appropriate title blocks for Capstone Projects.\n\t\nCapstone Drawing Checklist\n\tCapstone Drawing Guidelines details the required aspects of CAD drawings - Excel or PDFPlease review ALL drawings submitted for manufacturing against this checklist. This should help guide you to create complete and useful drawings of your components and assemblies. Expect your project engineer to review your prints against this checklist prior to authorizing production.\nThe following documents present additional information and tips on engineering drawings which may help clarify what the checklist is asking for.\n\t\n\tDrafting Practices\n\t\tDrawing Rules\n\t\tdimensioning_and_tolerancing.pdf\n\t\n\t\nManufacturing Processes Class - Technical Data Packets\nWe have two examples from this class that may be helpful as a reference. (Capstone projects typically DO NOT require this level of manufacturing  process documentation.)\n\t\n\tFerris_Wheel_TDP_-_CAD_Drawings.pdf \n\t\tFerris_Wheel_TDP_-_Industrial_Copy.pdf\n\t\n\t\nSchematics & PCB Layout\n\tFor schematic capture and PCB making there are numerous tools. These have been documented elsewhere in this wiki: Electronics Layout and Circuit Board Production\n\t\nMind Maps\nThere are several alternatives for creating Mind Maps.\n\t\n\tFreeplane (supersedes Freemind) is available on Sourceforge - http://www.freeplane.org .

Our goal is, as quickly as possible, to approve purchases that will be appropriate for your project! This is what you should expect to see at your future jobs whether in industry or academia! (you may have already seen it in clubs and Greek organizations.)\n\t\nCustomer Needs\n\tThe purpose of defining customer needs is so that we can determine the multiple technically based project requirements that are needed to meet those customer needs.\n\t\nProject Requirements\n\tFrom the technically defined project requirements, we create multiple concepts for addressing those. We can then establish the criteria needed to make or buy key project components.\n\t\nApproval Review\n\tWhen we are asked to approve any purchase, we do so only after looking at the proposed concept and the requirements it is intended to address. Only then can we begin to determine if the proposed purchase is the appropriate one! Please note that urgency is rarely a criteria used for approving purchases!\n\tPlease note:\n\tTeams need more than just a concept! Teams need a concrete design documented that fully shows how the items will be used (schematic, CAD, etc.) as well as supporting analysis showing how/why the item will work within the overall system. In terms of the design process, this usually means passing through concept generation and selection and getting into detailed design - before ordering parts, especially expensive ones.\n\tIn general, we do not need to purchase parts to see \"if they work\". Commercial parts are sold to meet their manufacturer's specs. We also do not generally order parts to see \"if or how easily they can be integrated\". Instead we use the available data sheet information for this.\nSome things that we normally catch during this review:\n\t\n\taccidentally ordering surface mount components when through-hole ones are to be used with a protoboard\n\t\tbuying actuating components like motors and relays that exceed the current or voltage capabilities of the electronics that were expected to drive them\n\t\tbuying actuators whose size or shape is dramatically different than needed\n\t\tordering parts that also need special mounting components which were not included in the purchase request\n\t\tnot buying enough or buying too many items for a variety of reasons. For components that are likely to get damaged through use or accident, we might need to order extras / spares. We evaluate remaining time in the semester, shipping delays and costs vs. the cost of the spares!\n\t\tfailing to follow the special process needed for all chemical orders.\n\t\n\tTo save time, money, and frustration all around, the Project Engineers all perform this review as part of the approval process. Our only goal is to help you get the right parts that your team can actually use to move your project forward. We do this based on the design process artifacts that are taught in IED and then used in Capstone, and more importantly, later in most of your careers.\n\t\nRelated Pages\n\t\n\tCAD Templates\n\t\tDiagrams and CAD\n\t\n\t\nFabrication\nAfter the above, follow the process outlined on the Capstone Support wiki for creating:\n\t\n\tParts machined/created by student team - Self Fabricated Part Process\n\t\tParts machined/created by RPI staff - Shop Fabricated Part Process\n\t\tParts created through rapid prototyping - Rapid Prototyped Part Process\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Self_Fabricated_Part_Process": "\nSelf Fabricated Part Process - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nCourse Materials  \n  \nSelf Fabricated Part Process\n\tGraphic below shows the process to fabricate a part yourself for a Capstone project.

The XX% score you see at the end is your \"first time\" score, meaning that the first time you answered the questions you only got XX% right.\n\tThe quiz is designed, however, so that you MUST answer each question correctly to get the next one. There is no other way to get through the course. At the end of the course, having correctly completed all questions (even if not on the first try) you get the survey.\n\tYou MUST not skip a question! Doing so will lock you out of the test and you'll have to contact the Percipio admin to have a new test created for you.\n\tShop Safety Guidelines are posted within the shop and also available to the right here - https://manufacturing.eng.rpi.edu/facilities\n\t\nChemical Safety Guidelines\n\tANY chemical to be used in the Design Lab shop or on a student project must go through an approval process.\n\t\n\tReview the Instructions for Acquiring Chemicals - posted on Templates and Forms\n\t\tFill out the Preliminary Chemical Assessment form and submit to Project Engineer. - posted on Templates and Forms\n\t\tCreate a Standard Operating Procedure (also posted on Templates and Forms) detailing the storage, use, disposal of the chemical, and required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

This will provide a solid technical foundation that is critical for project success.\n\t\nBackground and Motivation\n\tWhen engineers start working on a new project, the first order of business is to become familiar with the past work, terminology, and available information about the area. Prior to meeting with customers and stakeholders, engineers collect and organize their understanding of past work to help establish tentative project objectives and plans. This initial research is used to help frame appropriate questions for discussion with project sponsors, stakeholders, and colleagues/teammates.\n\tWhile all of your projects require creativity and innovation, chances are very good that technologies and/or system concepts already exist that you can modify and adapt to the needs of this particular project. As the old saying goes, it does not make much sense to reinvent the wheel. With this in mind you should meet with your team and list the key areas where understanding of existing technologies is critical to the success of your project.\n\tThe topic of your background memo does NOT represent your assignment for the entire semester, only for this first individual deliverable. Once the team has shared the background memos from each person, teams can and should assign team members to tasks based on skills and interests. When acting as a \"team\", individuals will naturally assist each other in accomplishing the project work.\n\t\nProcedures\n\tEach individual student must submit a free-standing memo (4 pages double-spaced) summarizing your findings to the team and project mentors. Students must follow the steps below. Please use MicroSoft Word to produce the memo. Post the original editable Word document as an attachment to an EDN Forum post - Do NOT post the contents of the Word document in the post.\nWorking together, the team should determine what areas to study (research). The goal is to provide background information, technical terminology, and a foundation for the project. Potential items could include :\n\t\n\tLiterature search for existing technology and methods (patents, academic papers, textbooks, etc...)\n\t\tUser interviews and consumer research about relevant products or technologies (e.g. Amazon reviews, experts)\n\t\tIdentifying / installing / practicing software or techniques which will be required for the project\n\t\tInstalling existing project software and verifying work done by past Capstone team(s)\n\t\tConduct testing or system operation described by the prior team to confirm the validity of Standard Operating Procedure and other instructions\n\t\nEach team member must have a unique topic. ie: An 8 member team will create 8 memos on 8 different topics. PE or CE will approve the list of topics.\n\t\n\tMemo topics loosely fall into 2 categories\n\t\n\tResearch - Identify relevant existing technologies, products, processes, systems, and/or patents. Document the information sources, such as a citation and URL, as a reply to your original topic message on the EDN.\n\t\tTesting - Repeat/conduct testing or installation as described by the previous Capstone team. Document issues encountered, update/improve existing documentation as necessary, describe final results - success, specific further work needed, total failure - why?, testing modifications needed, etc...\n\t\n\t\n\t\nLogistics\n\t\n\tTeam generates a list of background memo topics and posts the list to Background Info section of the EDN Forum\n\t\tPE/CE approves list (via EDN)\n\t\tTeam selects/assigns a team member to each topic.\n\t\tEach student starts a thread (message) on the EDN Background Info forum\n\t\tMemo should be posted to this thread as a reply to submit the assignment.\n\t\n\tThread title should be subject of memo.\n\t\tDocument file name should be 'BM_Memo-Topic-RCSID.docx'\n\t\tMake sure to include the problem statement so that the purpose of your memo is clearly presented.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nHelpful Hints\n\tThe purpose of the background memo is to help get you acquainted with the technical material and to increase the teams knowledge on the topics. If in doubt, ask your Project Engineer or the TAfor guidance. Be sure to restate (do not just copy) your assigned topic in the introduction so that the reader knows the goals and objectives for your memo.\n\t\n\tThe Background Memo template file contains some instructions and hints - Templates and Forms\n\t\tGrading rubric available on the Tasks and Due Dates page.\n\t\n\tSome useful tools provided by MS Word are:\n\t\n\tComment tool.\n\t\tTracking changes tool\n\t\tBibliography and citation tool\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Task_Guidelines": "\nTask Guidelines - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nCourse Guidelines and Policies  \n  Table of contentsTask GuidelinesTeam TasksIndividual Tasks\n\t\nTask Guidelines\n\t\nTeam Tasks\n\t\n\tTeam Contract\n\t\tStatement of Work (Phase 1 of Design Report)\n\t\tPreliminary Design Review and Poster\n\t\tPreliminary Design Document (Phase 2 of Design Report)\n\t\tFinal Design Document (Phase 3 of Design Report)\n\t\tFinal Presentation\n\t\tFinal Poster\n\t\n\t\nIndividual Tasks\n\t\n\tCover Letter\n\t\tBenchmarking Memo\n\t\tPreliminary Peer Evaluation and Self-Reflection\n\t\tIndividual CE Feedback\n\t\tFinal Peer Evaluation and Self-Reflection\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Team_Contract": "\nTeam Packet - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nCourse Guidelines and Policies  Task Guidelines  \n  \nTeam Packet\n\tCreate a team contract using the knowledge and skills acquired in Introduction to Engineering Design.

This is Phase 1 of the development of the team's Design Report. The Statement of Work is comprised of Sections 1, 2, 3, and Appendix A of the Design Report, covering the following four topics:\n\t\n\tSection 1 - Introduction \n\t\tSection 2 - Project Objectives and Semester Objectives (with specific measurable parameters)\n\t\tSection 3 - Engineering Tools and Methods (including any special resource requirements and issues that you will need to deal with)\n\t\tAppendix A - Initial Deliverables and Dates\n\t\n\t\n\tDesign Report Template available here - Templates and Forms\n\t\tGrading rubric available on the Tasks and Due Dates page.\n\t\n\tWhen you are saving your \"Design Report.docx\" file, do NOT rename it! It will continue to have that file name throughout the semester. Please be sure to place it in the \"Reports/Design Report + Poster\" folder in the repository with that name. All revisions should be done using the repository.\n\t\nHelpful Hints\n\t\n\tAvoid flowery prose - be concise and technically focused. Be sure all terms are clear or defined.\n\t\n\t\n\tFor Background and Motivation you should pull heavily from your project description and changes or new information (if any) from your sponsor meeting.\n\t\n\t\n\tFor Long Term Objectives and Customer Payoff think about what your customer is trying to do with your results that will mean better products, higher profits, contributions to society, etc. Probably your work will need to be combined with other developments, in follow-on work at RPI or at the customer's development labs, before that benefit is actually realized. This might be their 2-5 year plan. It is the 'big picture'. Your current semester's work is a bite sized chunk of that big picture. The part that many students get hung up on is the difference between \"Long Term Objective\" and \"Current Semester Objectives and Customer Payoff.\"\n\t\n\t\n\tCurrent Semester Objectives are the valuable results that you will produce and deliver to your customer in this one-semester course. As you can imagine, your grade will be in large part determined by how delighted your customer is with those results. These should include specific commitments by your team and should be project specific, not generic. Do NOT simply repeat the generic design process. If you are working on an on-going project, summarize the project history first so that it is easy for the readers to understand why you chose the semester objectives.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe Engineering Tools and Methods section should provide specific information on the technical aspects of work. It should convince the reader that the team has the technical know-how required to execute the project. Do not include project management approach details unless they specifically relate to how the team will deliver their work. Some examples are shown in the table below.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tProject Area\n\t\t\tEngineering Tools and Methods\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSoftware\n\t\t\tScrum approach for iteratively releasing code to their sponsor for feedback\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFlow chart of system control loop, storyboard of user input\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMechanical\n\t\t\tFree Body diagram to show relationship of force vectors\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTorque measurements on the shaft to determine maximum system loading\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tProcess\n\t\t\tConduct customer interviews of toddler caregivers\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCreate Standard Operating Procedure for system startup and calibration\n\t\t\n\t\n\tIn the above software example, the \"agile\" item is not as technically interesting as the \"iterative release\" aspect since it is assumed that teams will use good project management techniques. Do not just list the names of software packages / engineering tools. Instead describe how you will apply them in the context of your project. Do not simply re-state the generic steps of the design process - make this unique to your specific project.\n\t\n\tAnother pitfall is to fill the Deliverables and Dates list with course items, like the Preliminary Design Document or sponsor visits / field trips. This list is instead intended for completion of specific intermediate project accomplishments (like analysis, experiments, design drawings or fabrication of parts) that will lead to the deliverables needed to satisfy the Current Semester Objectives. Make sure to include deliverables that are tangible items. Leverage the S.M.A.R.T. approach (described elsewhere in the wiki). Be sure that your deliverables are project specific rather than generic. They are the output of the tasks, not the task themself. The deliverables should relate to the items you identified in the Current Semester Objectives section ex: when will you deliver on those objectives. Schedule your deliverables to leave the last week of classes free for you to complete the academic requirements, ex: the final report, project archive, shop cleanup, etc.\n\t\n\tTask: Research competitors' products.\n\t\tDeliverable: A report on competing products.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nNext Steps\n\tOnce you have your deliverables defined in the Statement of Work, one team member should follow the instructions found on the Self-learning Materials page to create the Versions (also called milestones) within the EDN for your team. Everyone will need these when they begin to enter their Issues as each Issue needs to be tied to it's appropriate Version.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Gantt_Charts__Project_Management": "\nGantt Charts  Project Management - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  \n  Table of contentsGantt Charts / Project ManagementBasic Capstone How To GuidesProject Management ResourcesWritten ResourcesVideo Resources\nCommon problems students encounter, and how to solve them:PurposeTerminologyWork Breakdown Structure (WBS)MilestoneTasks\nPlanning ToolOther Resources\n\t\nGantt Charts / Project Management\n\tThis page provides information and guidelines for project management and creating / using EDN's built in Gantt Chart features.\nIt may be helpful to know that there are multiple stakeholders for your project management:\n\t\n\tteam members\n\t\tCE\n\t\tPE\n\t\tsponsor / mentors\n\t\n\t\nBasic Capstone How To Guides\n\t\n\tQuick Start Guide\n\t\tProper way to CLOSE an issue\n\t\tReviewing your Gantt Chart\n\t\tCreating SMART Goals\n\t\tCreating Versions (also called milestones)\n\t\n\t\nProject Management Resources\n\tFor Capstone, we are not expecting that all of our students will eventually become project managers! We do expect, however, that many students will work within a project oriented job setting or that a future job setting might benefit from adopting project management techniques.\n\tThe resources below are intended primarily to expose you to the benefits and the language & terminology used in project management.\n\t\nWritten Resources\n\tThere are many articles on this topic - some for training purposes to help people become project managers or to further develop their skills, some to help explain why a company should have or employ project managers and some that are introductory.\n\tThe selection of resources listed here are intended only to help explain why applying project management is important.\n\t\n\thttps://www.lucidchart.com/blog/why-is-project-management-important - good explanation of why project management is important.

Some focus on the career path of a project manager, some focus on justifying why one is need and there are many tutorials and on-line courses about project management that are intended to help individuals learn these skills.\n\tThe video(s) below are intended to help you understand why project management is important and why we feel that students should develop some basic project management skills.\n\t\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp7w5wdv9_Y - good introduction to why we need project management\n\t\n\t\nCommon problems students encounter, and how to solve them:\n\t\n\tWhat do I do with old issues?\n\t\n\t\nPurpose\n\tThe purpose of the Gantt chart is to facilitate a successful project. It is to help team members communicate among themselves to their project sponsors/mentors and to their Chief and Project Engineers. It is NOT a homework assignment to be done and forgotten! It IS a living document that must be updated and maintained regularly, adding new items as they are identified and updating the status of existing items. It will show who is the owner of each task and when it is due / available so that others can plan their own work.\n\tIt is a tool for teams to help hold team members accountable for their work - in terms of quantity, timeliness and quality.\n\t\nTerminology\n\t\nWork Breakdown Structure (WBS)\n\tOne of the first steps to project planning is to create a Work Breakdown Structure. This document Sample_WBS_by_Task_Types.pptx will show a sample WBS. We recommend that you do a brief web search for other examples and more information.\n\t\nMilestone\n\tThese are the major deliverables of your project. EDN calls these \"Versions\". Be sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these! Milestones are reached by achieving a series of tasks (see below). Milestones represent an all or nothing measurement. Either your team has reached the milestone or they have not!\n\tThis website has some helpful information on understanding what makes a milestone: https://www.ittoolkit.com/how-to-it/projects/project-milestones.html\n\t\nTasks\n\tThese are the steps you must take to get from one milestone to another. Each task represents a measurable chunk of work. As a result, a team can measure it's progress toward a milestone by examining the individual tasks required to get there. EDN calls these 'Issues' and will automatically calculate the percentage of issues completed to reach a given milestone.\n\tBe sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these!\n\t\nPlanning Tool\n\tThis file can be printed on 11x17 paper. It has rows for each team member's name and columns for several weeks. Each team member can then fill in what they plan to do for each week to contribute to the project. This can then be team reviewed and used to identify planning gaps and or overlap - Fill_In_Gantt_Chart-v4.xlsx.\n\t\nOther Resources\n\tThe Project Management Institute has a large amount of information on their web site: https://pmiteach.org/\n\tAttachments Below\n  Files (6)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Fill_In_Gantt_Chart-v4.xlsx    (18.9 KB)\n    Fill_In_Gantt_Chart-v4.xlsx  \n  printable template for collecting everyone's planned activities\n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2010-10-07 11:30 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Sample_WBS_by_Task_Types.pptx    (224 KB)\n    Sample_WBS_by_Task_Types.pptx  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2011-01-14 01:38 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Effectively Using SMART.pptx    (69.9 KB)\n    Effectively Using SMART.pptx  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2016-11-15 09:42 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    SMART Goals Poster.pptx    (84.8 KB)\n    SMART Goals Poster.pptx  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2018-09-05 03:22 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    SMART_goals_poster.png    (85.1 KB)\n    SMART_goals_poster.png  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2018-09-05 03:24 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    10 Reasons Why Projects Fail v2.pdf    (1.84 MB)\n    10 Reasons Why Projects Fail v2.pdf  \n  title is self-evident!

When completing an issue be sure to include information that explains how or why it got finished.\n\tThere are a number of ways to leave breadcrumbs to this information depending on where it is located on the EDN.\n\t\nWiki\n\tFor information placed in the Wiki, include a link to the relevant page.https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/EDN_FAQ#Where-do-I-put-information\n[[EDN_FAQ#Where-do-I-put-information]]\n\t\nRepository\n\tFor information kept in the Repository, you can include a link to a particular committed version in the Repository (1st example below) or to the most recent version of the file (2nd example below). The first is the \"r\" format where you use the letter r and a number to indicate the specific repository revision number as in \"r1234\" (1st example below). This will create a direct link to the files in that revision. The second is the \"source\" format where you point to the file in the repository. This method will create a link that automatically/always points to the latest version of that file. The syntax is: source:path in your repo to the file which should be quoted as shown since your path usually includes blanks.r52\nsource:\"template documents/After Hours Request.xlsx\" \n\t\nForums\n\tFor information in the Forums, you can include a quick fancy link to the forum thread (1st example below) or just copy the url to a later reply (2nd example below).(note Capstone Support has no Forums, so the examples below for a project you are not a member will be unreachable)For the first, the 6 digit ID for the thread is a the end of the url.For the second, you can hover over the 'RE:forum topic\" and copy the direct url.\nmessage#152797\nhttps://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/boards/3607/topics/152797?r=156246#message-156246\n\tRemember that once closed, an issue will not appear on the default view (which shows only \"Open' issues), so information may get 'hidden'. It will still be discoverable via the EDN search box. There should always be a link or breadcrumb left as the issue is closed to lead to the location of the artifact justifying completion of the task.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Reviewing_your_Gantt_Chart": "\nReviewing your Gantt Chart - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  Gantt Charts  Project Management  \n  Table of contentsReviewing your Gantt ChartProject Management\n\t\nReviewing your Gantt Chart\n\tThis should be done EVERY week at least once. Each member of the team is responsible for updating their own tasks. Generally, successful teams will also appoint one person to monitor the Gantt chart to remind team members to make updates.\n\tFYI - issues will not show up on the Gantt chart unless they have a due date!\nA typical project management / Gantt chart review process (not in any particular order):\n\t\n\tis there a link to the forum where the issue is being discussed / developed / addressed? Always use the forum for the discussion, use the issue to track progress.\n\t\tis there a link to the file(s) in the repository where the work is being placed? You must provide evidence of the output/results of the issue before it can be closed. The author of the issue should be providing these links. A second person (the 'closer') should validate that the link(s) are present and working/correct and that the work found there actually relates to the issue. The the 'closer' can actually close the issue.\n\t\tis EVERY task assigned to someone?\n\t\tthere should NOT be a category named \"To-Do\"! There is already a tracker for that!\n\t\tDo the categories represent the major subsystems for your project? Additionally there may be a category for \"Documentation\" or \"Project Management\".\n\t\tonce a person has been assigned, the status must be manually changed to \"assigned\" \n\t\tare the tasks 'meaningful'? Are they important enough to bother adding to the Issues list? Short tasks that might be completed in an hour or two are often not meaningful in terms of the overall project plan. Adding them just increases the 'noise' in the project plan making it harder to determine the actual tasks that need to be performed. Group these small items into a checklist for a single larger task.\n\t\tall tasks that have not yet been started need to have a more appropriate start date entered!\n\t\tall tasks must have an end date so that they appear on the Gantt chart\n\t\tare the relationships between tasks entered? You can \"link\" tasks to show that one task precedes another. this can be done when you view an issue - there is a \"related issues\" section.\n\t\tdoes EVERY person on the team own at least one remaining issue? why not?\n\t\teveryone should have issues that they own for the rest of the semester.\n\t\tall of the tasks should be about one week or less in length\n\t\tall of the tasks should have a useful description, not just a one line title\n\t\tdo not use academic titles, for example do not use names like 'Detailed Design', 'Define Requirements' - these don't communicate enough specifics to be useful.\n\t\tavoid generic names for versions or issues. For example, do NOT include things like \"Milestone 1\", \"Milestone 2\", etc. in a version name even though the syllabus may name them like that!\n\t\tavoid generic names like 'Release 1', 'Release 2', etc. Instead use a name that actually describes WHAT will be delivered in each release.\n\t\tBe sure you use terms that are unique / specific to your project for issues and versions. They will provide a much stronger communication of what your team is doing on your specific project! That will help your sponsor as well as the Chief / Project Engineers  know what you are doing.\n\t\twhen updating the percent complete, you should be posting a link to the artifact(s) that show that progress. This might be a repository version, forum posting, attachment to the issue, or a wiki page that has been created/updated\n\t\tdoes each issue have a target Version?\n\t\tdoes each issue have a category assigned?\n\t\tare you properly using the trackers: feature vs. bug vs. to-do\n\t\tis there an important document attached to an issue? If so - post it somewhere more appropriate! Anything attached to an issue will become hard to find once that issue is closed and no longer appears on your open issues list! Avoid putting important documents in an issue. Put them in a forum where you can and should discuss and review them. Use the issue to mention where it was posted AND to manage it's schedule and to track the progress toward completion.\n\t\tare there tasks left over from a previous semester that have not yet been closed? Why? Are they completed but not marked as closed? You need to verify that status before closing them.\n\t\tTasks from a previous semester may need to be reassigned to a current team member and rescheduled with dates and a version that is relevant to the current semester.\n\t\tLook for the term \"SMART\" or \"S.M.A.R.T.\". Your issues should follow those guidelines.\n\t\tDo not add never-ending tasks like \"Project Management\" or Wiki Webmaster\". These are really roles that perform ongoing activities, not measurable tasks. If a specific task is eventually identified that can be measured and completed in a week, then add that item instead.\n\t\tDo not create parent tasks that have only one sub-task (child task). Only create parent tasks to show how a large effort is broken down into smaller, shorter pieces or to show how the multiple elements of a complex task are divided among the team members.\n\t\n\t\nProject Management\n\tIf you are unclear on project management itself, on the differences between tasks and milestones, on what Gantt charts are or the why and how they are used, we recommend you visit YouTube as there are many excellent videos available on these topics.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Subsystems": "\nSubsystems - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  Gantt Charts  Project Management  \n  \nSubsystems\n\tAn engineering system is often broken down further into subsystems to make it easier to understand, design, fabricate, etc. Each subsystem typically performs a function.\n\tIn a similar manner, a project may be divided into a number of tasks that need to be performed.

Issues should be tied to a \"release\" or \"version\" which will properly group them on the Gantt chart.\n\tFor more information regarding EDN Issues, start here - Gantt Charts / Project Management\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/SMART_Goals": "\nSMART Goals - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  Gantt Charts  Project Management  \n  \nSMART Goals\n\t\nMake it SMART\n\tIn general, your issues should be \"SMART\" / \"S.M.A.R.T.\".

Rather every issue needs to be looked at and dealt with appropriately.\n\t\nStep 1 - Determine completion\n\tFind out if the issue was completed or not.  This can be done by the group checking the existing product, by asking someone from that semester or the Project/Chief engineers if the issue was completed.\n\t\n\tIf completed: Edit the issue to change the Status to Closed\n\t\tIf not complete: Move on to Step 2.\n\t\n\t\nStep 2 - Determine relevance\n\tDecide if the issue is relevant or not.\n\t\n\tIf not relevant to current or future semesters: Change status to Closed.\n\t\tIf not relevant to current semester but may be to future: Change Assignee to no one (If needed) and change Target Version to \"Unscheduled\".\n\t\tIf relevant to current semester: Assign issue to someone on the team and change the Target Version and Category to appropriate current semester title.\n\t\n\tNote: Any time an issue is updated always give a brief explanation for the update as a comment.\n\tThe Gantt chart by default shows Open issues only. So changing status to Closed or Assigned/Working will automagically clear out old work off the Gantt chart.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Self-learning_Materials": "\nSelf-learning Materials - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nCourse Materials  \n  \nSelf-learning Materials\n\tChoosing one of the links below will open that document for you.

It is in some respects similar to Subversion which became widely used before git was developed - much as Subversion was developed in 2000 to replace the commonly used version control Concurrent Versions System (CVS) ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System ).\n\t\nObtaining the Software\n\tFor Windows Subversion we use TortoiseSVN. For Windows Git we can use TortoiseGit, available at: https://tortoisegit.org/download/. Almost all of our PC's are 64 bits now so be sure to download that version.\n\t\nGetting Started for Git Users\n\tThis section applies to sponsors, students, faculty and staff who need to access a git repository. Users dop not have the ability to create a new git repository - only the system administrator can.\n\tThis section assumes that you have already installed Git according to the instructions for your operating system\n\t\nWindows Users - TortoiseGit\n\tTortoiseGit is accessed by right-clicking on a Windows explorer folder.\n\t\nTypical Command Line Usage\n\tThis is the user sequence for the command line on Mac or Linux or for Windows users with Cygwin.\n# one time only to get started\nmkdir my-project\ncd my-project\ngit init\ngit remote add origin https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/git/my-project\n# you'll be prompted for EDN user name and EDN password\n# for convenience, set your RPI email and real name\ngit config --global user.email \"RCSID@rpi.edu\" \ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name Here\" \n# done before starting any work, each time work is to be done\ngit pull origin\n# you should now have a copy of all that ws on the server\n# do work\n# tell git to pay attention to everything or to only specific for\ngit add . (or specific files)\n# tell git to add them to the local \"repository\" \ngit commit -m \"reason for commit\" \n# tell git to send them up to the cloud where others can access things\ngit push origin master\n# if the push command fails you may need to do this one time before you can push\n# it tells git where the push goes within the cloud\ngit push --set-upstream origin master\n# list what is in the remote. No details unfortunately as subversion supports\n# it will prompt for username & password\ngit ls-remote\n\t\nCreating a Git Repository on the EDN Server\n\tThis is an administrator-only function!\n\tThis script will perform the steps required to create the repository on the EDN server. While the user's repository on their PC is referred to as their \"local\" one, this is referred to as the \"remote\" repository.\n#!/bin/sh\n# Mark Anderson\n# create new git repository\nname=\"$1\" \ngitloc=\"/data/git\" \n# check if name was provided on command line else prompt\nif [ -z \"$name\" ]\nthen\n        echo \"Enter new git repository name:\" \n        read name\nfi\n# make sure a name was provided\nif [ -z \"$name\" ]\nthen\n        echo \"git repository name required! Exiting...\" \nfi\necho \"Git repo $name will be created & initialized at $gitloc/$name\" \nsudo git init --shared --bare   $gitloc/$name\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data $gitloc/$name\nsudo chmod 755                  $gitloc/$name\n\t\nNotes\n\tThe above script could be enhanced to confirm that the requested repository does not already exist.\n\tIt is NOT valid to create a git remote repo on the server and then simply copy it to another name. The above commands must be run to create each new repository.\n\t\nConfiguring the git Repo within the EDN\n\tWhile configuring a Subversion repo requires the URL to the repository, configuring a git repo requires the on-disk local file system path to the repo, e.g. \"/repo-location/git/repo-name\" where repo-location is the folder where we are keeping all repositories.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Preliminary_Design_Review_and_Poster": "\nPreliminary Design Review and Poster - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nCourse Guidelines and Policies  Task Guidelines  \n  Table of contentsPreliminary Design Review (PDR) and PosterPoster-Based Design ReviewDress Code for PresentersPoster\n\t\nPreliminary Design Review (PDR) and Poster\n\tDesign reviews are an opportunity to share information and get feedback as part of an open and honest dialog with reviewers.  They are often used in practice to determine whether a project should proceed forward to the next stage in the development process. The preliminary design review consists of a poster-based design review and a preliminary design report.\n\tA poster-based design review is an interactive process.  It should not be a \"rehearsed\" presentation where you read off note cards or a script. Use the elevator pitch taught in PD3 to present a big picture of the project at the beginning of a review session.\n\tStudents should expect an in-depth discussion between themselves and reviewers/audience - including answering specific questions that arise, offering demonstrations if possible, etc. Use the poster as a visual aid to show data and strengthen concepts, not as a slide show.\n\t\n\tDesign Report Template available here - Templates and Forms\n\t\tGrading rubric available on the Tasks and Due Dates page.\n\t\n\t\nPoster-Based Design Review\n\tThe Preliminary Design Review (PDR) is poster based, NOT based on a PowerPoint presentation like the status update meetings. Prepare a poster in PowerPoint (Microsoft or Open Office / Libre Office) format that team members will use to explain the project to interested students and faculty, most of whom will have no prior knowledge of the project.  DO NOT use Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Visio, Google Docs, Google Sheets or ANY other software packages! The template page setup is 3 feet by 4 feet in landscape mode. Two posters will not be allowed. If your team needs more space (because of a large team with distinct sub-teams), consult with your Project Engineer and Chief Engineer. See below for the suggested contents.\n\tThere will be three shifts during class time. Every student must present at least once. Create three sub-teams, and each sub-team will have 20 minutes to describe your project and project plan with at least 5 minutes for Q&A. Reviewers may ask questions DURING the flow of the presentation. This may make presenters uncomfortable but is much better to transmit information. If the audience is confused, that can be cleared up immediately rather than continuing without understanding, i.e., real time feedback. This also prevents useful questions or suggestions from being forgotten before the end of the presentation time.\n\tEach sub-team will cover the entire project, so it is best to divide your team into balanced sub-teams. You will be evaluated as individuals on communication skills, including but not limited to: oral presentation, using a poster, and answering questions.\n\tDownload your poster file to your computer and use a desktop version of PowerPoint. You can turn the shape of a cursor to a red laser pointer to draw attention to a part of your poster.\n\t\n\tPress and hold the Ctrl key, click the left mouse button, and drag the mouse (pointer) to the contents. For more information, see Turn your mouse into a laser pointer\n\t\n\tEach sub-team should also have a designated Note Taker for each shift. This person will not present material or answer questions but document comments and suggestions the audience may offer. This note should be uploaded to the EDN and shared with the full team after class. If necessary, a student(s) can repeat in this role. However, (again) each team member MUST present during at least one shift.\n\tTeam members who do not present the poster during each shift will attend other presentations by a different capstone team.

Have an appropriate background.\n\tThe standard for the preliminary design review is Business casual.  For more information, see presentation attire guidelines.docx\n\t\nPoster\n\tPrepare a poster that team members will use to explain the project to reviewers who may not have prior knowledge of the project. The poster should be mostly pictures, diagrams and graphs.  Most of the words will be filled in by you. If you put in the effort and are well prepared, introducing your project to reviewers using your poster will be easy, rewarding and fun.  Much of this information should already be in your Statement of Work! Do not start from scratch - just re-use that information!\n\t\n\tPoster template available here - Templates_and_Forms\n\t\tGrading rubric available on the Tasks and Due Dates page.\n\t\tExample posters\n\t\n\tDESIGN LAB PORTFOLIO  2015-16 Final.pdf \n\t\tDESIGN LAB PORTFOLIO 2018-19.pdf\n\t\n\t\n\tPlease include the following in your poster:\n\t\n\tPurpose of the Project - Who is your customer / what is the purpose of the project, from the customers perspective?  In other words, how will the customer benefit when your project and follow-on work meets the long term objective of this effort? You should find that you can use words from the Long Term Objective and Customer Payoff in your SoW to answer these questions.  Illustrations could include a diagram of the system that will incorporate the technology you are working on. This information should already be in your Statement of Work!\n\t\n\t\n\tPast Work - If this is a continuing project from last semester, give description or pictures of what was built and what the performance was.  Whether or not the project is new to RPI, you should include some illustration of past work by others on this problem.  This information should already be in your Statement of Work!\n\t\n\t\n\tCurrent Semester Objectives (System Requirements) - What will your team accomplish this semester?  Include a bullet list of the key deliverables along with some sort of  system diagram.  Be sure to specify any quantitative requirements that your deliverables will need to meet.  As much as possible, objectives must be specific and measurable. This information should already be in your Statement of Work!\n\t\n\t\n\tTechnical Approach, Results, and Accomplishments up until this review - This is project dependent. If you have built an early prototype, show a picture or design drawing.  If you have done tests and measurements, present graphs, and be prepared to discuss what the results mean.  If you have done technology trade-off studies, show the key results.  If you have done calculations show key results -- graphs are good, equations should be used sparingly.  Be ready to explain the significance of your results. This is your opportunity to show your progress toward achieving project success.\n\t\n\t\n\tNext Steps and Plan - Include words and illustrations that indicate how you will meet your semester objectives.  What engineering tools and methods will be used? DO NOT include a detailed planning chart (such as a Gantt Chart).  Think carefully about the words you used to describe your plan. Include any special challenges or equipment needs.  You should also talk about societal, safety, and ethical issues. The time frame for these steps and plan is current semester. Work to be done by the next team or sponsor will be mentioned on final poster.\n\t\n\tBe sure to include some graphics or discussion of overall System Architecture. Flow chart of a process, sketch of fixture with part in machine, or product within use environment helps to communicate the big picture.\n\tPlease see Creating Posters for suggestions on preparing your poster. Be sure to review your proposed poster with your Project Engineer the week before it is due so that you can get feedback and still have time to make revisions. Again, check with your Project Engineer and Chief Engineer for guidance on what is best for your particular project.\n  Files (3)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    presentation attire guidelines.docx    (14.4 KB)\n    presentation attire guidelines.docx  \n  \n  \n      Junichi Kanai, 2019-02-15 02:58 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    DESIGN LAB PORTFOLIO  2015-16 Final.pdf    (3.88 MB)\n    DESIGN LAB PORTFOLIO  2015-16 Final.pdf  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2021-07-09 03:05 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    DESIGN LAB PORTFOLIO 2018-19.pdf    (5.14 MB)\n    DESIGN LAB PORTFOLIO 2018-19.pdf  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2021-08-17 01:02 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Creating_Posters": "\nCreating Posters - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \n  Table of contentsCreating PostersPoster DesignOverall checklistStrategyStyle\nPoster MechanicsPoster Template\n\t\nCreating Posters\n\t\nPoster Design\n\t\nOverall checklist\n\t\n\tUse Capstone template\n\t\n\tPoster template available here - Templates_and_Forms\n\t\tCorrect size (36\" x 48\")\n\t\tCorrect header and footer\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDesign Lab logo and sponsor logo\n\t\tPlain white background\n\t\tProof read: equations correct, figures labeled, spelling correct.\n\t\tReadable: rule of thumb - poster printed on standard paper (8.5 x 11\") held at arms length - every character should be readable\n\t\tMicrosoft embedded objects - use Excel chart objects, not pictures or images of Excel/Word content\n\t\tNo excess significant figures - nothing screams amateur and unbelievable more than excess sig figs.\n\t\n\t\nStrategy\n\t\n\tThe poster should tell a story! Use your elevator speech to outline the story.\n\t\tThe poster will be used as a prop for your presentation. It is your \"note card\".\n\t\tThe poster should be able to communicate what your project is about even if you are not there to actually explain it.\n\t\n\tPosters stay up for visitors - you will not be there.\n\t\tPosters are compiled for publicity - you will not be there.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUse your previous work - this is not an exercise in creative writing. Especially your Statement of Work (SoW)! \n\t\n\tPurpose - long term objectives from the SoW: the big picture\n\t\tBackground - Condense your SoW.\n\t\tSemester objectives - straight from the SoW (condensed as needed). \n\t\n\t\n\t\tAccomplishments are real tangible things - something a sponsor would pay for. Administrative and planning tasks are not accomplishments.\n\t\tEngineering Tools and Methods are not project management or the engineering design process.\n\t\n\tshow your engineering skills by telling us what software, calculations, theories, approaches you will use.\n\t\tex: Will you do an FEA? How about PSPICE for circuit analysis? \n\t\tDo not just list tools, tell what you will actually DO with them. ex:  \"Use MATLAB to simulate control system response to variable x\".\n\t\n\t\n\t\nStyle\n\t\n\tAs few words as possible - do not use complete sentences.\n\t\tUse bullets or tables instead of paragraphs. Bullet point text should not exceed one line.\n\t\tUse images, tables, charts, graphs images.\n\t\n\tshow YOUR accomplishments (preferred) or those of others (such as the previous team)\n\t\tcondense or eliminate text\n\t\tavoid anecdotal data (cherry pick) - ex: parametric evaluation of result rather than a single point example\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUse color only with purpose! Do not create a splashy poster just for the art of it. Use the color to code things or to separate material.\n\t\tThe poster MUST be readable! Full size on your laptop screen held at arm's length must be readable.\n\t\n\tDiagrams must be readable! Use blank space in graphs for legends, figures, annotations\n\t\tPictures must be annotated - point to the features that cause the picture to be added in the first place.\n\t\tPictures should not have cluttered backgrounds - take time to take good pictures or use image editing to enhance\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUse section headings per the template if possible. We publish these in an annual book and we want them to all look similar.\n\t\tAvoid so-called \"weasel words\" - nebulous unquantifiable fluff that adds little or no value: \n\t\n\t  actions: familiarized, learned, understand, research...\n\t\t  adjectives: robust, optimal, ideally, theoretically, perfectly... \n\t\t  goals: efficient, expensive, cheap, strong... Quantify these as measurable requirements instead.\n\t\n\t\n\tThis table may help explain the relationship / purpose of the three key sections of your poster:\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tObjectives\n\t\t\tEngineering Tools and Methods\n\t\t\tNext Steps\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWHAT things you need to deliver\n\t\t\tHOW you will deliver those things\n\t\t\tThe ACTIONS needed to deliver those things\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\nPoster Mechanics\n\tFollow these for printing and producing your poster.\n\t\n\tSelect Arch E or a 3ft wide by 4ft long paper size option to print your poster. \n\t\tAlthough the plotter paper is 36 inches wide, the actual printable area is 34 inches or less. Make sure to allow 1\" margins.\n\t\tMain bullets should be 66 point font or larger for legibility.\n\t\n\tIt is acceptable for legends/graphs/diagrams to have smaller font due to space constraints. You can verbally describe during presentations. Audience can move closer to inspect/understand afterwards.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tReview your poster before sending it to a plotter. Print a poster on a letter size paper (8.5\" x 11\") using a color printer. Keep your arms straight and hold the sheet. This simulates the condition of a reviewer reading your 3 by 4 poster when you are standing in front of your poster. Make sure that it is easy to read and that the color scheme is working. Avoid complex backgrounds because they can distract from your message. Using a simple white background is almost always the best choice.\n\t\tWhen printing, DO NOT use glossy paper! This is more expensive, takes longer to dry, and is often more difficult to read due to glare from lighting in the room.\n\t\tIt often takes three or more hours to print and dry a poster. It is a good idea to send your print job to a plotter at least one day before your presentation. Information about the plotters in the VCC is at this link:  http://helpdesk.rpi.edu/update.do?catcenterkey=78\n\t\tHang your poster before the class!\n\t\tBe sure to post both the source file and a pdf file on the EDN. The source file is needed to create a final poster at the end of a semester, and for anyone else to edit.\n\t\tOnly PowerPoint should be used to create the poster. Tools such as Microsoft Publisher, Visio, Draw.io, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and similar tools are not to be used as not everyone has these tools. Web based tools are not to be used because the project's IP would then be stored in a non-RPI cloud system.\n\t\tCost of plotting poster will NOT be reimbursed through team budget.\n\t\tMost Project Engineers (Anderson, DeBoer, Paster) department affiliation is 'CORE'.\n\t\n\t\nPoster Template\n\tTemplate is located here - Templates_and_FormsIt is the same format for both the Preliminary Design Review and Final Posters.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Preliminary_Design_Document": "\nPreliminary Design Document - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nCourse Guidelines and Policies  Task Guidelines  \n  \nPreliminary Design Document\n\tInstructions are embedded within the Design Report template - Templates and FormsBe sure to complete the appropriate sections for Phase 2 as detailed in the color coded image on page 1.\n\tContents should be similar, but with more depth and detail, than what is covered in team's Preliminary Design Review and Poster\n\t\n\tDO NOT START FROM A FRESH COPY of the Design Report template.

Adjust formatting to fit ALL names on a cover sheet! Teams are blindly using the template and spanning two pages with the list of names.\n\t\tThe section on engineering standards - it is NOT acceptable to reproduce, in their entirety, any copyrighted standard - and they ALL are. Cite them. But explain, specifically, how they affect your project, what requirements you added based on them and how you are addressing them. Do NOT just list them!\n\t\tBreak your project plan up by milestone and EXPLAIN your schedule. If anything is 'red' you must explain why that is so and what the team will do to address it. Your Gantt chart at midterm MUST adhere to the guidelines found in the Capstone Support wiki!\n\t\tUpdate the Table of contents, list of figures and list of tables before submitting! They sometimes contain numbering errors or incorrect page numbers from earlier updates.\n\t\tIf a table spans multiple pages you must repeat the headings. Word will do this for you - automatically - if you tell it to. And you must!\n\t\tExecutive summary should encourage a busy executive to read your entire report. It should summarize your >report< especially your accomplishments. The executive summary should not primarily cover the project's history. Too many reports have only 1 paragraph at the end that mentions the current semester. It would not cause a busy executive to take time to read the report.\n\t\tAlphabetically sort the Terms & Abbreviations section.\n\t\tUse numbered sections/subsections - as in the template.\n\t\n\t\nMicrosoft Office\n\t\nMicrosoft Word for Technical Reports\n\tSome time saver tips for simplifying your final report preparing are included in the attached PowerPoint file. MS_Word_Tips.pptx\n\tAvoid having a table's row break across a page. For Word, this can be stopped using this tip found at http://www.lockergnome.com/windows/2007/09/21/prevent-table-rows-from-breaking-across-pages-in-word/\n\t\n\tSelect the appropriate table.\n\t\tFrom the Table menu, click Table Properties.\n\t\tClick the Row tab.\n\t\tUncheck the 'Allow row to break across pages' option.\n\t\n\t\nEquation Editor\n\t\n\tError when editing an equation in Office\n\t\n\t\nOffice 365\n\tOffice 365 and OneDrive @ RPI provides an overview for RPI students.\n\tA web browser version provides a subset of features.  For more information, see Differences between using a document in the browser and in Word\n\t\nMaster Document and Subdocuments\n\tMS Word allows authors to combine chapters files and create a single document. Some tutorial materials are as follows.\n\t\n\tCreating a Master Document Using Existing Subdocuments\n\t\tYoutube - Create Master and Sub Documents in Microsoft Word (4m30s)\n\t\n\tIt is not easy to combine references, and there are two solutions.\n\t\n\tTextbook Approach - You can create a Bibliography at the end of each chapter.\n\t\tPostprocess - See Problems with references and master documents for a solution.\n\t\n\t\nCreating and Using Equations\n\tThe Linear Format method is significantly faster to enter equations than the GUI method. However, it requires you to memorize TeX-like commands. For details, see Typing Equations via Linear Format\n\tThe commands are found in the \"Math Autocorrect\" tab in the Equation Options.\n\t\nComparing and Merging Microsoft Office Documents\n\tThis information can be found on this page: Comparing and Merging Microsoft Office Documents\n\tIf you manually merge two Word files, such as cut and paste a section from a document to the other file, citations are also copied. You need to update the bibliography (references) by pressing F9 or using the Update Field option.\n\t\nEmbedding Slides or Spreadsheets into other Documents\n\tWhen inserting PowerPoint slides or spreadsheet results into presentations or Word documents, DO NOT paste them in as images. It is almost always better to embed the Excel or PowerPoint source into the destination document (Word or other PowerPoint presentation). If you paste in an image of the spreadsheet or slide then it cannot be revised unless the original separate spreadsheet or PowerPoint can be found. This often causes challenges for teams as that document has proven to be difficult to find! Sometimes the original was never posted to EDN and is lost. To make a revision the spreadsheet or slide must be recreated from scratch, a great loss of productivity.

This allows complete trace-ability of needs and requirements in your documentation as long as you do not change any of the numbering! Instead, simply add new items after the existing ones. Do not insert needs or requirements into the middle of the list. Just add them at the end of the list to keep the numbering intact.\n\t\nOther versions and examples:\n\t\n\tUse this review form ( Requirements_Check_List.doc ) as a guide line and make sure you did not miss any critical requirements/specifications.\n\t\tUseful books and references - the requirements spreadsheet provided in IED can be found here.\n\t\n\t\nGathering Needs\n\tCustomer interviews, benchmarking research, and product reviews will generally produce a large list of user comments and complaints. Often this does not uncover 'obvious' unspoken needs or other aspects not customer focused.Following list of Requirement Types may inspire team to generate additional needs for the design:\n\t\n\tFunctionality\n\t\tPerformance (Quality)\n\t\tSafety\n\t\tAesthetic (Look and Feel)\n\t\tUsability\n\t\tAccessibility\n\t\tReliability, Durability, and Availability\n\t\tManufacturability and Material\n\t\tTechnical  Example: The system must be written in Python.\n\t\tMaintainability and Support\n\t\tCost (Development and Manufacturing)\n\t\tEnvironmental impact\n\t\n\tSome types are closely related. For examples:\n\t\n\tReliability is related to performance (quality).\n\t\tRepairability is also related to environmental impact.\n\t\tMaterial is related to environmental impact because of recyclability.\n\t\n\t\nDefining Requirements\n\tRemember that the gathering of Customer Needs and then converting those into Project Requirements was covered in IED!\n\tThe attached file atlee-chapter4.pdf is an excerpt from a book on software development. This chapter broadly covers requirements gathering and definitions for software projects.\n\tRequirements for software packages can be managed using other techniques - Software Requirements Specifications\n\t\nUser Stories\n\tAnother powerful tool for gathering requirements is the \"user stories\". There are many resources on this to be found online. Although perhaps developed and widely used in the software development area it can also be applied to other areas.\n\tIn the simplest form, it consists of documenting who the user is, what they need to be able to do, and what the benefit / reason is.\nTemplates:\n\t\n\tAs a [type of user], I want to [perform some tasks] so that I can [achieve some goals].\n\t\tAs a [type of user], I want a [feature] so that I can [satisfy a need].\n\t\nFor example:\n\t\n\tAs a student I must regularly post technical contributions to the Electronic Design Notebook so that I can collaborate effectively with my team.\n\t\tThe car's transmission must transfer the energy from the engine to the wheels so that the vehicle can move.\n\t\tAs a driver I must be able to control the car's energy transfer so that I can go forward and backward.\n\t\tAs a driver I must be able to control the car's energy transfer so that I drive slowly and fast both with a boat/trailer attached and without it.\n\t\n\tIt is often desirable to be able to sort these by the user type/role, so it is recommended that these be kept in a simple spreadsheet like this one - User Stories.xlsx\n\t\nAcceptance Criteria\n\tUser stories describe functional needs.  We write acceptance criteria to add details to user stories to make them more specific and measurable (testable). A user story gets one or more acceptance criteria.\nFor example:\n\t\n\tAs a user, I want a reliable system so that I can use it to complete assigned tasks.\n\t\n\tAcceptance Criterion: The downtime of the system is less than 15 minutes/day.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAs a user, I want a secure system so that my data is protected.\n\t\n\tOnly authorized users can access the system.\n\t\tWhen a user failed to be authenticated three times, the user account is locked. (And) The user must contact the system admin to unlock the account.\n\t\n\t\n\tATTACHMENTS BELOW\n  Files (4)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    use cases.xlsx    (10 KB)\n    use cases.xlsx  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2015-11-20 09:39 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    atlee-chapter4.pdf    (1.21 MB)\n    atlee-chapter4.pdf  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2016-02-10 01:32 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Requirements_Check_List.doc    (38.5 KB)\n    Requirements_Check_List.doc  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2021-02-23 04:56 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    User Stories.xlsx    (15.5 KB)\n    User Stories.xlsx  \n  User Stories Template File\n  \n      Junichi Kanai, 2021-08-02 09:58 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Software_Requirements_Specifications": "\nSoftware Requirements Specifications - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.');

This provides a record of the decision making processes used during the project. Meeting minutes allow missing members of your team to stay up to date. This includes your Sponsor/Mentor, Project Engineer and Chief Engineer!\n\tThis task should rotate among the team members, to ensure every student generates at least one memo.  These minutes should summarize important activities and progress during the course of the semester and include a list of weekly assigned tasks, responsibilities for completing tasks, and estimated time and resources for completion.  The team should maintain an updated list of action items as a regular component of the minutes of a meeting.  It should highlight any issues that the team is facing and corresponding actions that the team is taking to solve problems. Submit the minutes of a meeting as a message in Project Management forum and avoid attaching a Word file because attachments are not searchable in the EDN.\n\tThere are MANY resources on the web for taking good meeting minutes - a fast search will yield many! In particular, look at the templates offered by Microsoft Word and/or Open Office - but do not take your minutes in these tools. Use a simple plain text editor instead.\nIn general the meeting minutes should record:\n\t\n\tDate/time of the meeting\n\t\twho took the minutes\n\t\twho is present, who was missing\n\t\n\tIf no one missed the meeting, state the fact, i.e. None.\n\t\tdocument late arrivals and early departures as needed \n\t\n\t\n\t\tthe agenda items that were discussed / key discussion points\n\t\tresults of the discussions, ex: decisions reached\n\t\taction items including (who / what / when):\n\t\n\tdescription of the item\n\t\twho owns the item / who will do the item\n\t\tthe due date for the item / when it will be available to the team\n\t\tif no action item was identified, document the fact, i.e. \"No action item was identified.\"\n\t\n\t\n\tEDN's issues tool provides an excellent method for recording these action items. Simply use the \"To Do\" category and if all the fields are filled in you will have an accurate record of the who / what / when aspects for each! You can then track progress of these on EDN by simply updating the status regularly.\n\tDO NOT take your minutes in Word/Open Office and then attach a \"doc\" file. It is MUCH easier on the reader to see the information directly in the posting rather than having to open a document to get it. Even worse is to paste the text into the posting AND still attach the same thing as a \"DOC\" file! Now the reader has to open the attachment only to find that it's the same as the text in the posting.  Posting as plain text also allows easy searching for information using EDN's search functionality.\n\tDO post a picture or a photo of your whiteboard as an attachment.\n\tA simple template has been created - export:template documents/Meeting Minutes.txt\n\tThis is a text file that you can edit for your meeting minutes. Please do not use word processing tools such as Word as they will introduce formatting problems. Please do NOT attach the file! Instead, copy & paste  the text directly into the EDN comment box for proper formatting.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Error_when_editing_an_equation_in_Office": "\nError when editing an equation in Office - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Microsoft Office Tips & Tricks  \n  \nError when editing an equation in Office\n\tIf you get an error when you try to edit a report or presentation provided by a previous team, see the following links:\n\t\n\tEquation Editor - https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Equation-Editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f\n\t\tSymptom and Solution - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4057882/error-when-editing-an-equation-in-office\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Tips_&_Tricks": "\nMicrosoft Office Tips & Tricks - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  \n  \nMicrosoft Office Tips & Tricks\n\tVarious \"solutions\" we have found for commonly encountered problems:\n\t\n\tComparing and Merging Microsoft Office Documents\n\t\n\t\n\tConverting a Wiki page into a MS Word file\n\t\n\t\n\tError when editing an equation in Office\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Comparing_and_Merging_Microsoft_Office_Documents": "\nComparing and Merging Microsoft Office Documents - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Microsoft Office Tips & Tricks  \n  \nComparing and Merging Microsoft Office Documents\n\tThere are some relatively new features in Microsoft Office that vary from version to version.

Pandoc is a command line tool for converting one document (markup) format to another. It can convert a wiki page into a MS Word file.  This document briefly introduces the basic conversion steps.  A full pandoc user guide is found at http://pandoc.org/README.html.\n\t\nInstalling pandoc\n\tPandoc's home is http://pandoc.org/. If you are not using MS Windows, follow the installation instructions found at http://pandoc.org/installing.html.\n\tFor Windows, go to the download page from http://pandoc.org/installing.html. Click the button to download the latest installer. Note that the current installation package is pandoc-2.14.0.3-windows-864_64.msi, as of July 7, 2021.\n\tRun the installer and follow the instructions.\n\t\nPreparation Method 1 - Copying a wiki page into a text file\n\tPandoc can include images in a wiki page into the corresponding MS Word file.  Both the text file containing the wiki and the images must be in the same folder.\n\t\n\tFirst time only: Create a working folder.\n\t\n\t\n\tPrepare the wiki text file.\n\t\n\tOpen the EDN wiki page.\n\t\tChose the edit option.\n\t\tHighlight and copy the contents.\n\t\tGo back to the previous page or close the tab (page).\n\t\tUnder MS windows, open a Notepad.\n\t\tPaste the contents.\n\t\tRemove any unnecessary items, such as {{toc}}, in the file.\n\t\tSave the file in the working folder.  Make sure to choose UTF-8 from the Encoding option that is left of the Save option.\n\t\tClose the Notepad.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tIf two or more wiki pages must be converted, repeat the above steps.\n\t\n\t\n\tDown load image files that are at the bottom of wiki page and save them in the working folder.\n\t\n\t\nPreparation Method 2 - Creating a html file containing sub-wiki pages\n\tThis method does not retain attachments but includes sub-wiki text contents.

At this stage, the team should have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the problem and your proposed design solution.  All of the prior steps have lead to this point where your team will present the final report, which includes both a written technical report and oral presentation.\n\tThe written report and final presentation should be prepared in cooperation with all members of the project team.  Each team member will be evaluated on their content contributions to the report and design review.  In this regard, the team should prepare a summary work breakdown structure for both the report and presentation that clearly indicates individual contributions.\n\t\n\tSchedule for this semester's reviews is posted here - Final Design Review\n\t\tGrading rubric available on the Tasks and Due Dates page.\n\t\n\t\nFinal Design Review\n\tThe Final Design Review is a PowerPoint-based design review. It will be scheduled in cooperation with your project mentor and evaluator for some time during the last two weeks of the semester.  In some cases, the design review may be scheduled during the reading days or during finals week.  One to two hours should be allocated for the review.  The audience will include sponsors, mentors, advisors, evaluators, and consultants associated with the project.\n\tThe dress code for the final design review is business casual.\n\tFinal review is NOT simply the final status update. It is NOT short round robin style talking points off a poster like the PDR review. It is an overview of the ENTIRE project, with evidence of the design process being followed. The full audience will the PE, CE, and sponsor (all live), but also future students who may continue the work and other members of sponsor organization who will incorporate project output into their operation. They would start by reading your final report and reviewing the final review slide deck to get the complete picture. It is NOT a dear diary form of presentation. It mostly follows the order / structure of the Design Report. Because others / future teams will not see you present the slides, it's critical that all the essential information be on the face of the slides. ex: Do not plan to simply display an unlabeled graph and explain everything verbally.\n\t\n\tYou typically need to have about 30-40 minutes of presentation - the balance of your time will be taken by questions and discussion.\n\t\tYou only need about 30-40 slides to talk to for a 30-40 minute presentation - about one minute per slide.\n\t\tAll remaining slides can be placed to the back of the presentation after a slide with \"Additional Data\" on it.\n\t\n\t\nFinal Poster\n\tTeams must update their poster from the PDR to reflect the final status of the project. Teams should NOT create a new poster unless the project has taken a completely different direction since the PDR. Rather, this provides the opportunity to capture the additional items learned/achieved since the Preliminary Design Presentation. 'Next Steps' section should be replaced with 'Accomplishments' section.\n\tSubmit both the PowerPoint source file and a PDF version in your repository's working folder.\n\tPlease hang your final poster in the classroom, and let your PE and CE know that the task is completed. If the room is in use, leave the poster with Valerie Masterson.\n\t\n\tDO NOT START FROM A FRESH COPY of the Poster template. You should build on the poster file already used for the PDR Review at midterm. Some sections will need very little work or changes.\n\t\n\t\nFinal Design Document\n\tThe Final Design Document (Phase 3) should build on the Preliminary Design Document (Phase 2).  Be sure to include your key accomplishments compared to your objectives.  You should also include a statement for stakeholders on the significance of what you have achieved and recommended next steps.\n\t\n\tDO NOT START FROM A FRESH COPY of the Design Report template. You should build on the document already submitted as Phase 2 at midterm. The initial sections probably need almost no work - Introduction, Customer Needs, etc...\n\t\tGrading rubric available on the Tasks and Due Dates page.\n\t\n\tSame caveat as Preliminary Design Document template - This template was created as a guideline for ALL of the various projects possible in the Design Lab. Not all sections may be applicable to your project (widget design vs concept exploration vs process improvement...) and this exact flow may not be appropriate. Speak to your Chief and Project Engineer with any questions or clarification.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Final_Design_Review": "\nFinal Design Review Schedule - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \n  Table of contentsFinal Design Review ScheduleCourse Scheduled FinalsOfficial Fall 2021 Finals Exam TimesScheduledNOT YET SCHEDULEDDRY run schedulesCompleted\nCourse Materials Return To Campus\n\t\nFinal Design Review Schedule\n\t\nCourse Scheduled Finals\n\tMultidisciplinary Capstone Design does not have a final exam.

Swanson Multidisciplinary Design Laboratory.  One of our first orders of business is to match you with available projects.  At this point, it would be helpful to know more about your interests and backgrounds.  As the first course assignment, you should prepare a resume and cover letter that we can use to better match your interests and capabilities with available projects.  Please write your cover letter as if you were applying for a job in the O.T. Swanson Multidisciplinary Design Laboratory.  Please see our website at http://mdl.rpi.edu/ for additional background information about the Design Lab, including examples of past projects.\n\tThis assignment is intended to give you practice in applying for a real engineering design position.  Explain why you want to work in the Design Lab and why this environment is well suited to your capabilities and interests. In other words, explain what you would do for the Design Lab and what the Design Lab would do for you. Include relevant experience and future career goals. Your cover letter should be no longer than one page in length.  Please create the file name as RCSID_letter.doc (for example steinm2_letter.doc).  Attach a copy of your resume.  Make sure to state your major and concentration, and highlight your skill set.

Technology Risks - Lack of Project Specific Knowledge and Skills\n\tIdentify the knowledge and skills needed to complete the project based on your technical approach. Study if the team has the necessary knowledge and skills or not.  As required, define appropriate tasks, such as conducting technology feasibility experiments and learning to use a new tool.\n\t\n2.    Resource Risks\nIf you need to use a shared resource available in the Design Lab or on campus, you need to check its availability and adjust your project plan as needs.  Examples are as follows.\n\t\n\tMany teams ask the Design Lab technician to fabricate their parts near the end of the semester.  Hence, you may have to wait for a long time to receive your parts. Your design must be completed, reviewed, and approved by your PE by the end of the 9th week.\n\t\tIf you need to borrow a particular apparatus or access a laboratory to perform a task, check its availability and schedule the corresponding tasks.\n\t\n\t\n3.    Procurement Risks - Lead Time and Resource Availability\nThings do not happen instantaneously. Therefore, you must anticipate delays when scheduling tasks.  Examples are as follows.\n\t\n\tYour design must be reviewed and approved by your Project Engineer before you can order parts and/or start fabricating it. It typically takes two more reviews before a design is approved. Therefore, you should plan at least two design reviews.  \n\t\tThe Design Lab uses RPIs purchasing system.  It takes a minimum of two to five days for your parts to arrive after submitting a purchase request to Valerie. Due to supply chain issues, some items may take significantly longer. When you plan to acquire parts, include a delay.\n\t\n\t\n4.    Missing (Unplanned) Tasks\nYou must review your project plan critically and make sure that all tasks were identified and planned.  Examples of tasks that were often missed are as follows.\n\t\n\tYour design must be reviewed and approved by your Project Engineer before you can order parts and/or start fabricating it. It typically takes two more reviews before a design is approved. Therefore, you should plan at least two design reviews.  \n\t\tYou must integrate subsystems to produce a complete system. Therefore, it is essential to define integration-related tasks and allocate time to integrate subsystems. \n\t\tYou must objectively demonstrate how well your system (solution) met the customers needs and requirements. List everything, such as hardware, circuitry, sensors, software, and so on, that you need to test. You may have to plan and create a test fixture, test software, test data, and/or sample materials.\n\t\n\t\n5.    Miscellaneous Risks - Unexpected Problems\n\tThings could go wrong.  How did you plan for delays and unexpected problems?\n\t\nTo Do\n\tExplain how you modified the project plan based on your risk analysis.\nTable 1  Project Risks and Risk Management Plans\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProblem (Risk)\n\t\t\tRisk Management Plan\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t1.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t2.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t3.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t4.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Class_8_Agenda": "\nClass 8 Agenda - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nCapstone Class Agendas  \n  \nClass 8 Agenda\n\t\nIn Class Activities\n\t\n\tPlaybook: capstone-support-dev:export:playbook/Capstone Playbook.pptx\n\t\nOut of Class Tasks/ Action items\n\tThese tasks should be completed before next class\n\t\n\tAddress any feedback on status update PPT\n\t\n\tSponsor liaison should email PPT to sponsor at least 24 hours prior to call.

In addition to preparing a final report, you must ensure all work by the team is posted.\n\tBe certain that original source files of all final deliverables (report, poster, SOP, etc..) are saved to the EDN and/or Repository. This means PPT, Word, Excel rather than just PDF versions. PDFs are difficult/impossible for future students or sponsor to make edits and advance the work.\n\tVerify the final versions of all CAD models, assemblies, software code, experimental setup and data, etc... are saved to the EDN and/or Repository.\n\tIf necessary your project mentor will transfer all documentation to your sponsor mentor. For more information on tagging and the use of Subversion, see the Subversion wiki page.\n\t\nHardware\n\tIf your team built prototypes and/or used the fabrication area, make sure to transfer your physical prototype(s) and unused material to your Project Engineer (or Scott Yerbury). If the team needs to send a prototype to the sponsor, prepare a shipping instruction and make the prototype ready to be boxed and shipped.\n\t\nWork Area Cleanup\n\t\n\tYou must clean up your assigned area.\n\t\tReturn all tools to their proper location.\n\t\tReturn all test equipment, such as cables and multimeters, to their proper location.\n\t\tReturn all Design Lab equipment that you signed out, such as NI DAQ modules, Arduinos, tachometers, etc. to your Project Engineer or other Lab staff member.\n\t\n\tIf you are unsure what equipment your team has signed out, visit Booty Bay to see a list of all equipment.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/End_of_Semester_Requirements": "\nEnd of Semester Requirements - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nCourse Guidelines and Policies  \n  Table of contentsEnd of Semester RequirementsEnd of Semester Work Flow\n\t\nEnd of Semester Requirements\n\tThese are general guidelines and requirements for all teams.

Industry and academia both place value on clear strong presentations!\n\tThere are many resources on the web to help you create strong presentations. The writing center may help but sometimes is not as helpful with deeply technical material such as your presentations.\n\tFor the mechanics of conference calls with your sponsors, please see: How to Hold a Conference Call\n\tWe have compiled some of our observations and our sponsors here based on the presentations our students have made.\n\t\nTypical Meeting Slides\n\tThe Design Lab has created a basic template for your status report presentations. It is located with the other Templates_and_Forms.\nThe above template includes the following typical slides for a progress meeting with your sponsor:\n\t\n\tCover slide with all team member names/graduation month & year/majors plus your Chief and Project Engineer names\n\t\tAgenda\n\t\tOpportunity for Sponsor to present materials\n\t\n\tNeeded at first meeting - let sponsor speak first!\n\t\tMay be needed during the semester. Can be moved elsewhere in the agenda as appropriate\n\t\n\t\n\t\tCurrent overall project status to plan, ex: your deliverables / dates / how you are doing on each one!\n\t\tResults / evidence of progress\n\t\tDemonstrations\n\t\n\tIf applicable / appropriate / available\n\t\tLive if possible, have video just in case!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tQuestions / anything needed from your sponsor\n\t\n\tQuestions\n\t\tResource requests\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNext steps based on your plan\n\t\tSchedule the next call if not already done. We recommend that you set the full semester schedule, while avoiding PDR, break and holidays, as soon as possible.\n\t\n\t\nGuidelines from a Sponsor\nThe overall presentation of material would benefit from a clear narrative and some key communication elements:\n\t\n\t    Start with an outline/overview of what is going to be covered\n\t\t    Tell the audience what youre going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what youve told them\n\t\t    Provide a clear introduction that defines the problem statement:\n\t\n\t    Citations or references showing/describing the need / basis for the project will help make a compelling intro\n\t\n\t\n\t\t    When multiple options are still under consideration (e.g. the controls system), provide a page that summarizes and compares the relative attributes of each. In some cases it is hard to compare on the basis of data  consider a decision matrix that puts weighting factors on various considerations\n\t\t    Individual slides  benefit from contextual information. Most slides should be clear enough to convey their message even if the presentation is being reviewed at another time, without narration or verbal explanation. \n\t\tPresentations are often used to document processes and results in lieu of formal reports/memos, so the information should be structured for archival use as well. Most (if not all) slides should clearly identify:\n\t\n\tWhat information is being conveyed\n\t\tDetailed diagrams capturing what is being presented: \n\t\n\tOverall system layouts and diagrams (label the various components on 2d/3d layouts and photos)\n\t\tFree body diagrams (for structural systems)\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat is the takeaway from the information on the slide\n\t\n\t\n\t\t    Concluding material:\n\t\n\tWhat are the results/conclusions/findings\n\t\tWhat areas require further investigation/study to clarify? What are the next steps?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t    At the end of the presentation, the audience should feel confident that the presenter(s) are subject matter experts. The data can speak for itself, but oftentimes the presenter needs to make the connections in the audiences mind and lead them to the desired conclusion in such a way that there is minimal remaining doubt or uncertainty.\n\t\t    At the end of the day your work may be judged not only by the quality of the work (the actual engineering and science), but also by the quality with which it is presented (the marketing, the narrative, the professionalism, the aesthetics).\n\t\n\t\nChecklist for the material\n\tNot necessarily in any special order:\n\t\nFormat\n\t\n\tBe sure the cover page has the date of the meeting / conference call.\n\t\tNumber the slides - all of them. Use a font size large enough to be easily seen and a color that provides enough contrast to be readable!\n\t\tDate the slides - all of them. \n\t\tMake the font size/color to be readable. \n\t\n\tAvoid yellow lines / text / boxes on white backgrounds and other similar low contrast combinations.\n\t\tAvoid faint colors / light gray for fonts - you need contrast to make the text readable.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tBe sure to include the Design Lab logo AND the sponsor's logo on every slide. Branding is important!\n\t\tBe concise!\n\t\tAvoid \"dear diary\" mode! Do not tell your story as time based like you would when recording in a daily journal. Avoid: we did this, then we did that, then we converted X into Y, our first version was A and now we have B... That is not the method for technical presentations .\n\t\tLabel and annotate your figures but watch out for 'craptions'.\n\t\tAvoid using too many significant figures. Just because your software outputs 10 digits does not mean they are all significant.\n\t\tUse numbers! Formulas! Diagrams! Show your engineering work!\n\t\n\tUse images or tables where appropriate / possible.\n\t\tUse bullets rather than paragraphs of text.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGenerally, avoid colored / image backgrounds as they tend to print poorly.\n\t\tDon't waste time on fancy slide templates! Concentrate on your technical content not the artistry of the slides!\n\t\n\t\nContent\n\t\n\tYou probably have too much text\n\t\tAlways have an agenda slide (see below).\n\t\n\tMake sure the items on it match the titles on your other slides. Same words, same order.\n\t\tConsider the agenda slide as the table of contents for your presentation.\n\t\tLater you can include this and skip over it but it helps everyone remember team members.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPut all content into a single PPT file. \n\t\tFor first call, include the team member names, majors and graduation years. \n\t\tInclude Project and Chief Engineer names.\n\t\tMake sure each slide has a point! Why is the slide there / what does it add? You may need to add a text box at the bottom to tell the viewer what you want them to 'take away' from the slide.\n\t\n\tDo not hide it in the Notes. \n\t\tDo not plan to \"tell\" those details.\n\t\tOther people may get a copy of your slides. They will NOT have heard your presentation - so they will only know what is on the face of the slides. If it's not there, it won't be communicated!\n\t\tThe next student team will be looking at your slides to figure out what you did. If the information is not on the slides, it won't help them.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDon't just embed links to other files / forum posts/ etc. in the slides. Some people print them and that link always fails in that case. Instead, for anything critical to know during the presentation, include a short overview or summary of the materials. Then a link may be OK - but provide the actual URL, not a named hyperlink like \"More Info Here\".\n\t\tYou probably still have too many words!\n\t\tBe sure your slides are showing evidence of your use of the Design Process!\n\t\tContrary to what you may have been taught so far in terms of presentations, for technical presentations put all the information ON the face of the slide. \n\t\tBEFORE you start creating slides, identify the purpose of the slides. What do you want to convey? What do you want them to learn? What do you want them to remember? What are the most important of these?\n\t\tFor EACH SLIDE, what is the message? What do you want to convey? What do you want them to learn? What do you want them to remember? What are the most important of these? You may want/need to actually put that ON the slide to make sure it is communicated.\n\t\tShow your milestones with dates and indicate where you are towards accomplishing those.\n\t\tShow progress! \n\t\n\tShow accomplishments and results. Don't talk about what you are working on - talk about what you learned / got from that.\n\t\tBe specific! Use numbers where appropriate.\n\t\tIdentify anything that will prevent you from reaching the milestone.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nScheduling\n\t\n\tAlways ask your Project Engineer to review your slides - at least 3 days before a conference call and always before you send out the slides! \n\t\tAlways send the slides to the sponsor at least 48 hours in advance to give them time to review and prep, especially if there are questions that the sponsor may need to research. It is generally not acceptable nor fair to your sponsor to send slides on the day of the call.\n\t\n\t\nProofread/Practice\n\t\n\tTry reading your material out loud. Things sometimes read differently than they sound and vice versa!\n\t\tIf possible or if the material is 'controversial', have a dry run with your Project Engineer.\n\t\tHas the whole team reviewed this? Proofed it? Agreed with it's content / completeness?\n\t\tFor each slide, ask yourself, what is the message you want to convey to the reader/audience? What is the purpose of the slide? EACH slide should have a clear purpose and a clear message.\n\t\n\t\nLogistics\n\t\n\tEmail a LINK to the slides, not the slides. Keep the sponsors information out of the email system as much as possible. If the sponsor requests an email, fine but all OUR internal work is to be done through the Electronic Design Notebook (EDN).\n\t\tUse a PowerPoint presentation to guide conference calls and meetings.\n\t\n\tAvoid needing to switch between multiple documents / applications / windows / files / etc. Unless you have a demo!\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEnsure that the most recent version of the PPT is on EDN. This should be what you sent to the sponsor.\n\t\tYou may have additional material that you want to include but may not actually present on the call. Create a slide titled \"Additional Information\" and put all that material in the back of your slide set - like an appendix in a report would be handled.\n\t\n\tIdentify any help you might need from your sponsor. Note - ALWAYS speak to your Project Engineer about this BEFORE you show/tell the sponsor! We might be able to help and not need to ask the sponsor.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nFinal Design Review\n\t\n\tReview the rubric to ensure your presentation addresses all points.\n\t\tBe sure to have an acknowledgement / thank you slide at the end for your sponsor and all who helped you.\n\t\n\tSlides aren't really ready for your Project Engineer to review until the TEAM has gone through the above criteria! We will help with the content but YOU need to make sure the overall presentation is complete as per the above list.\n\t\nGraphics\n\t\n\tApproved logos and graphics are available in Templates and Forms to be used for Posters, Presentations, and Reports\n\t\n\tDesign Lab Logos \n\t\tRPI logos and seal graphics\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPublic Speaking\n\tThere are MANY videos on the internet related to public speaking. In addition to those, recall your professional development activities in IED which were meant to prepare you for Capstone and your career!\n\tWe offer a small collection of tips here\n\t\nThings to Avoid\n\t\n\tRepeating things the previous speaker just said! If the previous speaker already said the things covered on the slide you are about to cover, do NOT repeat everything just so that you can be the one who spoke to 'your' slide! They are all, in fact, TEAM slides and it does not greatly matter WHO speaks to a given slide. In general, we DO care that everyone participates in the presentation but we are not logging \"minutes talking\" nor \"# of slides presented\" for each member of the team.\n\t\n\t\nHelpful PowerPoint Features\n\tThe following features are especially useful in online PowerPoint presentations.\n\t\n\tTurn your mouse into a laser pointer - Remote persons can also see an item you are pointing easily.

Worst case it provides a few key words to search or ask others about. Which is better than just saying \"It didn't work\".\n\tIf you tried to commit something and got red error messages, read them!\n\t\n\tIf the file is open in a program, you cannot commit it. Close that program first.\n\t\n\t\n\tIf you didn't type a comment in the 'Message' box, the system will not commit the file. This comment is to help explain what you did, so it is required.\n\t\n\t\n\tSpaces at the end of a folder name will not work. This sometimes happens on a Mac but apparently cannot be done on a Windows PC.\n\t\n\t\n\tMake sure you do not have file names with \"bad\" characters. It is possible to have a file name with an asterisk on a Mac but this is invalid on Windows. Try renaming the file in the repository (NOT on your PC's working copy) and see if you can do an SVN Update. If not, you may have to checkout the repository from scratch again. We don't have enough history for this scenario to have other possible solutions.\n\t\n\t\nCleanup\n\tSometimes a subversion update or commit gets interrupted for various reasons. Generally you can simply run the \"cleanup\" command one or more times to recover from this.\nIn the location you were trying to update/commit from: right click, Tortoise SVN, Cleanup. Be sure ONLY the following options are selected:\n\t\n\tCleanup working Copy status\n\t\tBreak locks\n\t\tRefresh shell overlays\n\t\tInclude externals\n\t\n\t\n\tIf that does not work, you will have to navigate to all the modified folders below that one (look for the red exclamation point next to the folder name) and repeat the \"right click, Tortoise SVN, Cleanup\" steps.\n\tIf that fails, try to navigate to the folder above and try the cleanup again. Repeat this until you have hit the top level of your repository.\nIf it still fails, you will have to checkout a fresh working copy of your repository as you did at the start of the semester. \n\t\n\tRENAME the old 'broken' one first to keep it. \n\t\tCheckout a fresh working copy.\n\t\tCopy any files (NOT folders! This must be done by copying one or more files at a time but never a folder!) that you have changed and were unable to commit from the old broken folder to the newly checked out folder.\n\t\tCommit the new folder\n\t\tAfter all files have been copied / committed then the broken working copy can be deleted.\n\t\n  Files (1)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    cleanup_window.PNG    (30.6 KB)\n    cleanup_window.PNG  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2020-07-10 10:20 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Why_not_Git": "\nWhy not Git - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Subversion  \n  \nWhy not use Git\n\tMost students have never used any version control tool before taking Capstone Design. Thus, Subversion (SVN) is favored because of its simplicity. SVN requires less steps to upload a file to an existing remote repository than git does.\nNew Files\n\t\n\tSVN: add -> commit\n\t\tGit: add -> commit -> push\n\t\nModified Files\n\t\n\tSVN: commit (Note: It is not necessary to \"add\" already tracked files.)\n\t\tGit: add -> commit -> push\n\t\n\tHence, there is very little chance for students to accidentally not upload files to the team's repository using SVN.\n\tIn addition, a centralized repository is sufficient for capstone design projects because of team sizes. Furthermore, teams almost never use advanced features, such as branch and merge, to manage their development efforts.\n\tNote: TALK to your Project Engineer before expending any effort on non-SVN repositories. This MUST be a TEAM decision, as maintaining two different repositories for a single project negates all the value of a version controlled system.Preliminary instruction for Git use on a Capstone project.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Capstone_Playbook": "\nCapstone Playbook - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nCourse Materials  \n  \nCapstone Playbook\nThe Capstone Playbook is a guide to the first few weeks of class.

It's purpose is to be USEFUL! It should explain what is in the directory and, as needed, explain why or how to use it. This way others do not have to open every file to figure out what is in each and what they are for. Although file names should be meaningful, any that are not should be commented on in the README. Don't just restate the folder name in words in the README - explain it instead!\nA useful README should indicate:\n\t\n\thow to get started with the material in that folder, for example which CAD model to open first or which file should be read before the others. A good README is somewhat of a 'getting started' guide to that folder.  \n\t\tThe purpose of the directory, i.e., type of information stored.\n\t\tSoftware used and versions \n\t\tList of sub-directories and files stored.\n\t\tWhere / how to get started using the folder's contents. For example if there is a program in the folder, quick start instructions on how to run it would be very helpful in the README.\n\t\nEXCEPTIONS: \n\t\n\tSome software development tools generate many files and folders as part of 'compiling' or 'building' an application. These folders are dynamic and do not require README files.\n\t\tSome software applications may process entire folders of data at a time. The presence of a README file may break the code. In these cases, the README can be left out of that data folder but the README for the folder one level up should provide the explanations.\n\t\n\tGenerally README files are plain text files NOT WORD documents. That way they are readable even from a terminal / DOS session and don't require special software to access. A template (README.txt) is available. Please AVOID using Markdown format as that is NOT pre-installed on our computers! Yes, we know it provides very nice looking output. We know that it's free to download one or more tools to use it. But we already have a tool that is pre-loaded on our PC's and produces nicely formatted output. It's called Microsoft Word! Use plain text files for README files. If you need more, the information probably should be in the wiki! Or you really need some sort of user manual which would be best created in Word due to its full formatting capabilities.\n\tA sample README file for Final Report is shown below. If different files were created using different versions of the software (for example Microsoft Word 2013 vs. 2016 - then that needs to be noted on a folder by folder or file by file basis. Be sure to include the operating system and it's version as some teams use things other than Windows. Avoid fancy indenting - this is a plain text file and multiple indents quickly make the file hard to read.\nThis directory contains project reports.\nSoftware Used:\n    Windows 7, Ver.

In general, you can either post the file or files as an attachment to an issue, to a forum or to the wiki. Alternatively, you can place files in the projects' repository. You can then use a link to the file in your forum posting / wiki page / issue. EDN text formatting supports \"r252\" which will automatically create a link to revision 252. See the Subversion wiki page for information on how to use the repository.\n\tIn general, DO NOT compress files / folders to be placed in the repository - there should be no need to do so and it makes using / browsing the repository more challenging.\n\t\nHow to make files smaller\n\t\nMicrosoft Office files - PowerPoint (PPT) / Word (DOC/DOCX)\nIf you are using one of MS Office tools it is possible for the files to become large due to embedded graphics. This can be addressed by compressing the images in the file.\n\t\n\tSelect a picture. Chose \"Format\" under \"Picture Tools\" in the tool bar.\n\t\tSelect \"Compress Picture\".\n\t\tUn-check the box for 'Apply to only this picture'.\n\t\tSelect the appropriate resolution for the images. Unless you need to show details, you can use the \"Screen\" or even \"E-mail\" option to achieve good results.\n\t\n\t\nMultiple Files or a Single Large File\n\tYou can compress the files to reduce their size. It is possible to create a compressed \"ZIP\" file of a single file, multiple files or even an entire directory. Support for ZIP files is readily available in both Windows and LINUX. Please DO NOT use \"RAR\" format files as that is not built into Windows. Although free RAR support is available for Windows, many users do not have it or may not be aware of it. For the convenience of others, please use only the ZIP format.\n\t\nVideo Files - AVI Format\n\tThe AVI format is an uncompressed format resulting in relatively large files. To reduce the file size you can use a different storage format such as MPEG.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Creating_a_New_Wiki_Page": "\nCreating a New Wiki Page - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  \n  \nCreating a New Wiki Page\n\tThere are TWO ways to create a new Wiki page.\n\t\nMethod 1\n\t\n\tClick the edit button on your current wiki page\n\t\t   Create a link to the new (not yet existing) page.

That way you can link to that topic from anywhere in your wiki.\n\t\tDo NOT use the home page as a place to capture documents! Use the repository, attach to issues, post to the forum, or create more appropriate wiki pages to store documents.\n\t\n\tWe recommend that each project team put at least the following on their wiki's home page, changing the information below to match their project:\n\tNote that the below is provided as text that you can simply copy & paste into your own wiki.\nh1.

It is fairly granular - meaning that you can choose to watch individual things that you are particularly interested in rather than needing to watch and see \"everything\". Look for the \"Watch\" link at the top of wiki pages.\n\tOn Issues you are automatically set as a watcher for any issue you create. You can also add other team members as watchers when you create a new issue. When viewing an issue that you did not create, you can choose to watch/unwatch the issue by clicking that link near the top of the page. When viewing an existing issue you cannot add other team members as watchers.\n\tFor Forum posts, you can add yourself as a watcher but can not add someone else.\n\t\nRSS Feeds\n\tEDN also supports RSS Feeds. You can subscribe to your project with your favorite RSS reader and be automatically provided with updates on project activity. On some pages this is shown as \"RSS\" on others it appears as \"Atom\" which is an alternate type of news feed. To get the best overall view of your project, subscribe to the RSS feed on the Activity tab. For the RSS feed, update entries seem to be considered using the time of creation, rather than the time they were last replied to. Therefore, if someone has just replied to an item, it will not move to the top of your RSS feed.\n\t\nEmail Notifications\nThe EDN system will notify you of changes within your project's EDN via emails to your RPI account.Click 'My Account' in the top right and choose from the 7 levels of notification offered:\n\t\n\tFor any events on all my project - you are only member of one project. \n\t\n\tFor a student this might generate 0-15 emails/day\n\t\tEDN will PUSH all updates to you\n\t\n\t\n\t\t4 levels of granularity in between\n\t\tNo events\n\t\n\tThis will generate 0 emails/day\n\t\tYou will have to PULL whatever updates you require to keep up to date with the project.\n\t\n\t\n\t\nRegardless of your choice, you are responsible to have a ROUGH idea of where the whole project is and a CLEAR idea of your individual responsibility and task status\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Archiving_Past_Work": "\nArchiving past work - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  \n  \nArchiving past work\n\t\nHow do I \"hide\" or \"archive\" the previous semester's work\n\t\nIssues and Gantt Chart\n\tIn general you don't really want to do this. What most teams are trying to accomplish is to reduce the number of outstanding issues to make it easier to see what's on their list of things to do / manage.\n\tThere is NOT one correct answer for all old issues, so they must be individually reviewed and dealt with. Good project management suggests that you really need to review all those old Open issues, make a determination of whether the item is still valid or not and then handle each one accordingly. Essentially you are re-planning the old work.\n\t\n\tIf an item is really no longer needed, simply comment it as such and mark it Closed. If the work was not actually finished, DO NOT change the status to complete.\n\t\tIf the item IS still active / important then you need to change the completion date to one more meaningful (from the current semester) and change the Assignee to a member of the current team. The priority might also need to be updated and the associated Version (Milestone) would certainly need to be updated.\n\t\tIf the item as defined is not fully relevant but a new more appropriate item would be, then follow #1 above and simply create a brand new item with dates and names relevant to the current semester / team.\n\t\n\tThe Closed items will then no longer show on your list of Open issues but are still part of the project history. The items which are still Open will thus continue to appear on your team's Gantt Chart and Issues List so that you can manage them to completion.\n\t\nRepository files\n\tSubversion saves ALL versions of a file, but only displays the most recent copy. So there is really nothing to do. Filenames should not contain dates, semesters, version numbers, or individual names. The only visible file called \"Needs and Requirements\" will always be the latest, most complete copy. Simply make changes as necessary, and commit the file.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Sponsor_EDN_invite": "\nSponsor EDN invite - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  \n  \nSponsor EDN invite\n\tHere is a suggested email that can be used for inviting our Sponsors / Mentors to join EDN:\n\tDear \"Sponsor/Mentor\"\n\tThank you for sponsoring / mentoring our project!\n\tAs you may be aware, we use an online project space for communication, file sharing, and for our online \"Electronic Design Notebook.\"  You may have heard us refer to it informally as \"EDN\".\n\tWe invite you to register for accounts with this online project space, so you may view our progress, and so that you can share information directly in our design space.  Please follow this link and click on \"Register\" in the top right-hand corner of the Design Lab project website.\n\thttps://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/\n\tNote that your web browser may warn you of an expired or invalid security certificate.  We are aware of this issue -- it does not affect the security of the communications -- it is merely because we self-sign our certificate.\n\tOnce you have registered with the Design Lab's EDN project server, we will manually approve your account for access.  Before approval, we check each individual email address, and then assign each person to the appropriate project.  This yields a delay of about a day, in most cases, before you will be able to log in.\n\tOnce you have been approved, you will have access to all the same data as we do and may use it to communicate with us and share files.  Most communication takes place in the forums portion of the project space (located under the \"Forums\" tab).\n\tSincerely,The XYZ team\n\tSome sponsors may follow closely along with the team throughout the semester. Others may prefer to simply attend status updates and get information that way.Providing direct links to content within the EDN is often a good way to share documents/files and discussions.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Text_formatting_in_EDN": "\nText formatting in EDN - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  \n  \nText formatting in EDN\n\tWhen editing a Forum post, Issue, or wiki page there is a Help link just above the text box - a small question mark in a blue circle. That will open a short information page. It has a link to even more information. And on the http://redmine.org site there is a portion of it's wiki dedicated to this as well: https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineTextFormattingTextile\n\tThe following are the most commonly used formatting tricks for Capstone:* text1 - bulleted list of \"text1\" \n** texts - sub bullet indented from \"text1\" \n# text - numbered list of \"1. text\" \n# more text - second numbered entry \"2. more text\" \n## text - indented numbered item \"    1. text\" \nh1. Header level 1\nh2. Header level 2\nh3. Header level 3\nBe sure to leave a blank line after these heading commands or the next line will also be in this format!\n* #124 - clickable link to issue number 124\n* message#1224 - clickable link to forum message number 1224 - will display message title\n* r124 - clickable link to repository version 124\n<pre>One or more lines of Code Here</pre> will let you insert multiple lines of code with the formatting retained.\n* export:\"working/Engineering Design/needs and requirements.xlsx\" would link to the needs and requirements spreadsheet in the repository. \nNOTE that the double quotes are required because there is a space in the path / file name. \n* https://some.web.page/ - requires NO extra syntax and automatically provides that link to an external web page\n* [[Wiki Page Name]] - creates a link to that page in your team's wiki. Visiting a new page automatically puts you in the editor to create content.\n* %{color:red}red colored text% - colored text\n* %{background:yellow}Yellow Background% - black text on a yellow background\n\tWe recommend that you use the Preview feature to see what your post will look like BEFORE you save it as it can NOT be edited later.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/User_Icon": "\nUser icon - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  \n  \nUser icon\n\tEDN supports replacing the default 'user icon' with a picture of me (or other graphic) through the use of gravatars.

What most teams are trying to accomplish is to reduce the number of outstanding issues to make it easier to see what's on their list of things to do / manage.\n\tThere is NOT one correct answer for all old issues, so they must be individually reviewed and dealt with. Good project management suggests that you really need to review all those old Open issues, make a determination of whether the item is still valid or not and then handle each one accordingly. Essentially you are re-planning the old work.\n\t\n\tIf an item is really no longer needed, simply comment it as such and mark it Closed. If the work was not actually finished, DO NOT change the status to complete.\n\t\tIf the item IS still active / important then you need to change the completion date to one more meaningful (from the current semester) and change the Assignee to a member of the current team. The priority might also need to be updated and the associated Version (Milestone) would certainly need to be updated.\n\t\tIf the item as defined is not fully relevant but a new more appropriate item would be, then follow #1 above and simply create a brand new item with dates and names relevant to the current semester / team.\n\t\n\tThe Closed items will then no longer show on your list of Open issues but are still part of the project history. The items which are still Open will thus continue to appear on your team's Gantt Chart and Issues List so that you can manage them to completion.\n\t\nRepository files\n\tSubversion saves ALL versions of a file, but only displays the most recent copy. So there is really nothing to do. Filenames should not contain dates, semesters, version numbers, or individual names. The only visible file called \"Needs and Requirements\" will always be the latest, most complete copy. Simply make changes as necessary, and commit the file.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/My_file_is_too_large_to_put_on_EDN!": "\nLarge File Size - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  \n  \nMy file is too large to put on EDN!\n\tIf you are attempting to attach one or more files and you exceed the 9.8 Mb size limit, there are a few different ways to proceed. In general, you can either post the file or files as an attachment to an issue, to a forum or to the wiki. Alternatively, you can place files in the projects' repository. You can then use a link to the file in your forum posting / wiki page / issue. EDN text formatting supports \"r252\" which will automatically create a link to revision 252. See the Subversion wiki page for information on how to use the repository.\n\tIn general, DO NOT compress files / folders to be placed in the repository - there should be no need to do so and it makes using / browsing the repository more challenging.\n\t\nHow to make files smaller\n\t\nMicrosoft Office files - PowerPoint (PPT) / Word (DOC/DOCX)\nIf you are using one of MS Office tools it is possible for the files to become large due to embedded graphics. This can be addressed by compressing the images in the file.\n\t\n\tSelect a picture. Chose \"Format\" under \"Picture Tools\" in the tool bar.\n\t\tSelect \"Compress Picture\".\n\t\tUn-check the box for 'Apply to only this picture'.\n\t\tSelect the appropriate resolution for the images. Unless you need to show details, you can use the \"Screen\" or even \"E-mail\" option to achieve good results.\n\t\n\t\nMultiple Files or a Single Large File\n\tYou can compress the files to reduce their size. It is possible to create a compressed \"ZIP\" file of a single file, multiple files or even an entire directory. Support for ZIP files is readily available in both Windows and LINUX. Please DO NOT use \"RAR\" format files as that is not built into Windows. Although free RAR support is available for Windows, many users do not have it or may not be aware of it. For the convenience of others, please use only the ZIP format.\n\t\nVideo Files - AVI Format\n\tThe AVI format is an uncompressed format resulting in relatively large files. To reduce the file size you can use a different storage format such as MPEG.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Issue_Workflow": "\nIssue Workflow - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  Gantt Charts  Project Management  \n  \nIssue Workflow\n\tIssues have a status in EDN.

It may seem cumbersome, but is certainly sensible.\n\t\n\tExamples\n\t\n\t\"Why can't I assign multiple people? - A task with that much work shoudl be separated into multiple issues for better tracking and accountability?\n\t\t\"Why can't issue move from New to Complete?\" - How can it be finished if no work was done?\n\t\n\t\nOf course there are always exceptions (and corners to cut) as shown in green and red\n\t\n\tExamples\n\t\n\tTask identified later in semester after initial project plan entered into system -> Create task and immediately start @ Working status, skipping over New and Assigned\n\t\tWork begun immediately after owner is chosen -> Skip over Assigned status, moving from New to Working\n\t\tIncomplete documentation or output to be at Completed status -> move issue back to Working\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tFor multi-semester projects, it is generally appropriate to begin by a) reassigning old incomplete issues from a prior semester, or b) closing old issues, or c) rejecting old issues. There is NOT one correct answer for all old issues, so they must be individually reviewed and dealt with.\n\t\nCompletion percentage\n\t% Done is automagically reported in the Gantt chart based on status of the Issue\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tStatus\n\t\t\t% Done\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNew\n\t\t\t0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAssigned\n\t\t\t10\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWorking\n\t\t\t50\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tComplete\n\t\t\t100\n\t\t\n\t\n\tFor parent tasks, the % Done is computed from completion statuses of all the sub-tasks.\n\tgraphics above are slides 19 & 20 of Quick Start Guide - EDN FAQ\n  Files (2)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Issue_Workflow_-_standard.PNG    (32.7 KB)\n    Issue_Workflow_-_standard.PNG  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2021-07-01 01:41 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Issue_Workflow_-_exceptions.PNG    (29.7 KB)\n    Issue_Workflow_-_exceptions.PNG  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2021-07-01 01:41 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Gantt_Charts": "\nGantt Charts  Project Management - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  EDN FAQ  \n  Table of contentsGantt Charts / Project ManagementBasic Capstone How To GuidesProject Management ResourcesWritten ResourcesVideo Resources\nCommon problems students encounter, and how to solve them:PurposeTerminologyWork Breakdown Structure (WBS)MilestoneTasks\nPlanning ToolOther Resources\n\t\nGantt Charts / Project Management\n\tThis page provides information and guidelines for project management and creating / using EDN's built in Gantt Chart features.\nIt may be helpful to know that there are multiple stakeholders for your project management:\n\t\n\tteam members\n\t\tCE\n\t\tPE\n\t\tsponsor / mentors\n\t\n\t\nBasic Capstone How To Guides\n\t\n\tQuick Start Guide\n\t\tProper way to CLOSE an issue\n\t\tReviewing your Gantt Chart\n\t\tCreating SMART Goals\n\t\tCreating Versions (also called milestones)\n\t\n\t\nProject Management Resources\n\tFor Capstone, we are not expecting that all of our students will eventually become project managers!

This article focuses on the importance of using project management\n\t\thttps://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/why-is-project-management-important/ - good overview of the importance\n\t\thttps://www.managementstudyhq.com/project-management.html\n\t\tFile: 10 Reasons Why Projects Fail v2.pdf\n\t\n\t\nVideo Resources\n\tThere is no shortage of videos on project management. Some focus on the career path of a project manager, some focus on justifying why one is need and there are many tutorials and on-line courses about project management that are intended to help individuals learn these skills.\n\tThe video(s) below are intended to help you understand why project management is important and why we feel that students should develop some basic project management skills.\n\t\n\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp7w5wdv9_Y - good introduction to why we need project management\n\t\n\t\nCommon problems students encounter, and how to solve them:\n\t\n\tWhat do I do with old issues?\n\t\n\t\nPurpose\n\tThe purpose of the Gantt chart is to facilitate a successful project. It is to help team members communicate among themselves to their project sponsors/mentors and to their Chief and Project Engineers. It is NOT a homework assignment to be done and forgotten! It IS a living document that must be updated and maintained regularly, adding new items as they are identified and updating the status of existing items. It will show who is the owner of each task and when it is due / available so that others can plan their own work.\n\tIt is a tool for teams to help hold team members accountable for their work - in terms of quantity, timeliness and quality.\n\t\nTerminology\n\t\nWork Breakdown Structure (WBS)\n\tOne of the first steps to project planning is to create a Work Breakdown Structure. This document Sample_WBS_by_Task_Types.pptx will show a sample WBS. We recommend that you do a brief web search for other examples and more information.\n\t\nMilestone\n\tThese are the major deliverables of your project. EDN calls these \"Versions\". Be sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these! Milestones are reached by achieving a series of tasks (see below). Milestones represent an all or nothing measurement. Either your team has reached the milestone or they have not!\n\tThis website has some helpful information on understanding what makes a milestone: https://www.ittoolkit.com/how-to-it/projects/project-milestones.html\n\t\nTasks\n\tThese are the steps you must take to get from one milestone to another. Each task represents a measurable chunk of work. As a result, a team can measure it's progress toward a milestone by examining the individual tasks required to get there. EDN calls these 'Issues' and will automatically calculate the percentage of issues completed to reach a given milestone.\n\tBe sure to use the SMART approach to naming / defining these!\n\t\nPlanning Tool\n\tThis file can be printed on 11x17 paper. It has rows for each team member's name and columns for several weeks. Each team member can then fill in what they plan to do for each week to contribute to the project. This can then be team reviewed and used to identify planning gaps and or overlap - Fill_In_Gantt_Chart-v4.xlsx.\n\t\nOther Resources\n\tThe Project Management Institute has a large amount of information on their web site: https://pmiteach.org/\n\tAttachments Below\n  Files (6)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Fill_In_Gantt_Chart-v4.xlsx    (18.9 KB)\n    Fill_In_Gantt_Chart-v4.xlsx  \n  printable template for collecting everyone's planned activities\n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2010-10-07 11:30 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Sample_WBS_by_Task_Types.pptx    (224 KB)\n    Sample_WBS_by_Task_Types.pptx  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2011-01-14 01:38 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Effectively Using SMART.pptx    (69.9 KB)\n    Effectively Using SMART.pptx  \n  \n  \n      Mark Anderson, 2016-11-15 09:42 AM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    SMART Goals Poster.pptx    (84.8 KB)\n    SMART Goals Poster.pptx  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2018-09-05 03:22 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    SMART_goals_poster.png    (85.1 KB)\n    SMART_goals_poster.png  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2018-09-05 03:24 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    10 Reasons Why Projects Fail v2.pdf    (1.84 MB)\n    10 Reasons Why Projects Fail v2.pdf  \n  title is self-evident!

These are often 'hidden' because the standards are embedded in other things. Examples are provided below to help make this clearer.\n\tThere are many examples of standards that affect our project work. A recent web article from Electronic Design cited 10 standards organizations that affect engineers: http://electronicdesign.com/communications/10-standards-organizations-affect-you-whether-you-know-it-or-not\n\tThis website lists 181 standards organizations that students can reference: http://www.standardslearn.org/trainingcourse.aspx - a list of ANSI- accredited standard developers. A number of organizations publish standards including:\n\t\n\tANSI - http://www.ansi.org/\n\t\tASME - http://www.asme.org/\n\t\tASTM - http://www.astm.org/\n\t\tIEEE - http://www.ieee.org/\n\t\n\tMany of these are offered as published documents. The RPI library (and their website) offer access to a number of these publications.https://guides.lib.rpi.edu/subjects/engineering\n\tSome standards are internationally defined and 'agreed to'.\n\t\n\tISO - http://www.iso.org/\n\t\n\tOthers have become defacto standards due to many years of unofficial but common use.\n\tA search engine for standards is provided by National Standards Network\n\tIEEE Standards Education web site provides helpful information for understanding the role of standards in engineering and technology:\n\t\n\tIEEE Standards Education\n\t\n\tOn-Line Tutorial\n\t\n\t\n\t\nElectrical / Computer System Engineering\nExamples of things that might be considered de facto standards in the software field include:\n\t\n\tLinux distributions\n\t\n\tUbuntu\n\t\tDebian\n\t\tRed Hat\n\t\tSUSE\n\t\n\t\n\t\tUNIX distributions\n\t\n\tBSD\n\t\n\t\nExamples of internationally defined software standards include:\n\t\n\tVarious compilers such as:\n\t\n\tFortran\n\t\tANSI C\n\t\tC++\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFor web-based implementations\n\t\n\tW3\n\t\tHTML\n\t\tCSS (style sheets)\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFor software, there may be existing coding and documentation standards, for example:\n\t\n\tPEP8 - Python coding standard\n\t\n\t\n\tSee Computers__Software__Hardware__Networking also\nStandards also may be defined for various electronic aspects and may sometimes include a software aspect/component such as a protocol:\n\t\n\tCommunications\n\t\n\tRS232\n\t\tRS485\n\t\tUSB\n\t\tI2C\n\t\tBlueTooth\n\t\tFirewire (sometimes referred to as IEEE-488)\n\t\tSerial communications baud rates\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPower\n\t\n\tHousehold voltage / frequency. Although this varies by country, there is usually a standard for each. For the US, this is 120VAC nominal at 60 hertz. Other countries may use 240VAC nominal and/or 50 hertz.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tInterfaces\n\t\n\tTTL compatibility - For interfacing among TTL devices, the standard voltage levels are defined and all TTL compatible chips must conform to be interoperable. For example logic 0 = 0 volts and logic 1 = 5 volts.\n\t\tBatteries - these are now defined with a selection of standard physical sizes and voltages.\n\t\n\tAA, AAA, C, D = 1.5V\n\t\tsize for 9V batteries - called by multiple part numbers / designations but 'standardized'\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPhysical\n\t\n\twire gauge & current carrying capacity\n\t\n\tmay be referenced by other standards or codes, ex: the National Electric Code\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nMechanical Engineering\n\t\n\tComponents\n\t\n\thardware, ex: screws, bolts, and nuts are sized according to one of the multiple standards\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRaw Material\n\t\n\tpipe is available in standard (nominal) diameter and wall thickness - http://www.engineersedge.com/pipe_schedules.htm\n\t\tsheet metal is sized by gauge - http://www.engineersedge.com/gauge.htm\n\t\n\t\n\t\nIndustrial System Engineering\n\t\nMaterials Engineering\n\tThe Ashby classification method has become widely adopted.\n\t\nRobotic Machinery Safety Requirements\n\t\n\tA good overview of safety issues is provided in the article \n\t\tANSI/RIA for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems  Safety Requirements\n\t\n\tANSI/RIA R15.06-2012 is the latest.\n\t\tRIA R15_06-1999.pdf\n\t\n\t\n\t\nRegulations\n\tIn some projects, regulations/laws create design requirements/constraints.\n\t\nOccupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA)\n\t\n\tGeneral requirements for all machines - OSHA 1910.212\n\t\tMachine guarding - OSHA 1917.151\n\t\tUnexpected start - OSHA 1910.147\n\t\tEmergency switch and examples\n\t\n\thttp://www.ehow.com/facts_7638502_emergency-stop-switch-regulations.html \n\t\tOSHA 1910.179\n\t\n\t\n\t\nUseful Information\n\t\n\tRockwell Automation provides much useful information, both standards/regulations and implementation issues:http://www.ab.com/en/epub/catalogs/3377539/5866177/3378076/Principles-Standards-and-Implementation.html\n\t\n\t\n\tMilitary, DoD, Federal, NASA, DOE, and Government specifications, standards, handbooks, and publications:http://everyspec.com/\n\t\n\t\nAttachments\n  Files (2)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    29cfr1910.pdf    (4.81 MB)\n    29cfr1910.pdf  \n  OSHA pt. 1910\n  \n      Junichi Kanai, 2013-04-28 09:22 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    RIA R15_06-1999.pdf    (970 KB)\n    RIA R15_06-1999.pdf  \n  for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems  Safety Requirements\n  \n      Junichi Kanai, 2019-03-01 05:13 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Constraints": "\nConstraints - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  \n  Table of contentsConstraintsSafetyManufacturing / FabricationTime / Schedule / Manpower ResourcesEnvironmental / SustainabilityCompany / Sponsor MandatesBudgetBibliography\n\t\nConstraints\n\tConstraints are limits on design freedom. (Dieter & Schemidt, 2007, p.92) In general, constraints may be thought of as boundaries to a project. Ulrich and Eppinger, in their book \"Product Design and Development\", identify some constrains that XEROX applied to their Lakes project. (Ulrich & Eppinger, 2012, pp.68-69)\n\tThere may be multiple sets of constraints. For example, one set of constraints may apply to the design process, another to the manufacturing / production phase and a third set may apply once the item has been shipped / distributed / sent out for use.\n\tThe categories below identify some of the possible areas where constraints may exist.\n\t\nSafety\n\tThere are regulatory bodies such as OSHA that may impose constraints through their various rules. The existence of some of these rules may generate specific design requirements which would be documented separately from this constraint.\n\t\nManufacturing / Fabrication\n\tAs parts or products are created, there may be constraints. These may relate to the manufacturing processes available or to the range of materials available. For example if a company wishes to produce metal products, they must have the processes appropriate for the types of metal they plan to use. Thus their capabilities becomes a constraint. They can, of course, address this by simply adding the necessary processes or by outsourcing part of the work.\n\t\nTime / Schedule / Manpower Resources\n\tProjects do not have infinite amounts of time available to them! There are typically specific milestones that must be accomplished by specific dates. Teams also do not have unlimited human resources with which to accomplish the work. All of these form constraints to a project and must be managed properly for the success of the project.\n\t\nEnvironmental / Sustainability\n\tAdditional constraints may come from our ever more conscious awareness of the environment and a corresponding need to protect it. There may be constraints as to what emissions a factory can emit or how much is permitted. Certain emissions may be banned completely for new facilities but 'grandfathered in' for older existing ones.\n\tEnvironmental concerns extend beyond the earth itself. Additional environments include home / office / factory or other special locations. These may each have differing constraints on what may or may not be allowed / permitted / desired. These too should be documented as needed.\n\tCertain projects might have a focus on sustainability related issues. Some companies are currently looking at improving their sustainability metrics and may set certain constraints related to this.\n\t\nCompany / Sponsor Mandates\n\tA given project may have directives from the company or sponsor that serve as constraints. For example, it may be a company policy to avoid use of a competitor's product whenever the company makes a similar product. Or a company may be developing a new technology and this dictate that the solution must employ that specific technology.\n\t\nBudget\n\tAs with time and human resources, projects do not have unlimited financial resources. Your project's budget is this a constraint. It must be noted that the budgets that may apply to the design process are likely to be different from those that apply to the manufacturing / fabrication phase.\n\t\nBibliography\n\tDieter, G.

Often, \"the prototype\" is the goal for a team in that by the end of the semester they will have completed one or more prototypes of the device / system.\n\tBut long before that final prototype, multiple intermediate prototypes may be desired or required.\n\tConsider this example. The team requires a force sensor and must determine whether a particular sensor will properly work in their project's application. It may be required to physically prototype a measurement setup to verify this. This setup might include the sensor, a mount for the sensor, and in the case of a force sensor, some sort of load for the sensor to measure.\n\tAfter initial testing of this configuration the team may identify modifications to the sensor mount and create a second prototype. Testing using this configuration may suggest that a similar but different sensor would be a better choice. After making the necessary modifications and obtaining the new sensor a third prototype is built and tested. Assuming this configuration works as required it will be incorporated into the overall project prototype.\n\tThese are all prototypes! But they should not be confused with the project's final prototype(s).\nThe confusion sometimes arises when students consider their initial project descriptions. Typically these are written in one of two ways:\n\t\n\tthat the team will deliver a prototypes\n\t\tthat the team will deliver one or more prototypes\n\t\n\tIn the first case, it is clear that the end result will be a single prototype. The team may however, as shown in the example above, still need to construct many prototypes for testing of various aspects of the project. These may or may not be of value to the sponsor and thus may become deliverable or disposable.\n\tIn the second case, it should be clear that at the end of the semester the team will be delivering multiple prototypes. It is often not clear at the start of the semester whether these should be final / complete prototypes, multiple versions of the same prototype as it is expanded / refined during the semester or if it makes sense to also deliver some of the intermediate prototypes that were developed for testing. The team simply needs to determine this while working with their Chief & Project Engineers in collaboration with the project sponsor.\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/FMEA": "\nFMEA - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  \n  \nFMEA\n\tFailure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a structured approach to discovering potential failures that may exist within the design of a product or process.

This may be due to the quality of raw materials, production volume, and location of facility. 'Manufacturing Process and Systems' course has provided some rough estimates of production costs for typical processes. These can be used as a starting point for simple budget analysis and trade off analysis. Generally speaking, a capstone team should NOT still be using these numbers by mid-semester. More in depth research and accurate estimates should be obtained by that point.\n\t\n\tMPS_Real_World_Manufacturing_Costs.docx \n\t\t\"Product Design and Development\" textbook used in IED includes information on manufacturing costs of various components in Appendix B of ch. 11 - Useful_books_and_references\n\t\n\t\nPart Cost Estimator\n\tA decent on-line calculator for tooling and production costs for injection molding, sand casting, die casting, and machining can be found here.

Score each week:\n\t\n\t0.0 points - The student neither had any task for the week nor updated any task's status.\n\t\t0.5 points - The student had at least one task (issue) for the week and updated its status promptly.\n\t\t1.0 points - The student had at least one S.M.A.R.T. task for the week and updated its status promptly.\n\t\n\tThe history of a completed task includes a link to the corresponding output(s).  The following table shows the conversion from a total numeric score to a letter grade.\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLetter Grade\n\t\t\tTotal Score\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t10 or higher\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t9\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t8\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t7\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tF\n\t\t\t6 or lower\n\t\t\n\t\n\tHint: Make the duration of a task at most a week.

The CE may need to schedule some meetings outside of normal class time depending on their workload. The CE will use the nominal topic as a way to explore student communication, planning, and team participation. The CE should offer specific guidance as appropriate and always use the export:Rubrics/Oral Communication Rubric.pdf to provide feedback at the end of the session.\n\t\nFeedback 1\n\tStudents should come prepared to discuss their best technical contribution to the project. Reference to material posted on EDN is expected as part of the discussion.\n\t\nFeedback 2\n\tThe student should be prepared to discuss the takeaways from the preliminary design review. Project plan, subsystem definition, and technical problems could be topics of discussion. Student should be prepared to reference the poster and the Team's preliminary design review summary.\n\t\nFeedback 3\n\tThe student should be prepared to discuss project status and sponsor feedback from the most recent sponsor status review. Project risks, team deliverables, and technical contributions are likely topics of discussion.

RPI faculty and staff can create accounts within this. Anyone with a personal Webex account that uses their RPI email address may convert that to the corporate account. It appears that Webex may keep both a personal and corporate account with that email - so one has to pay attention when logging in to use the corporate access when appropriate. Specifically Webex Teams requires the corporate access.\n\t\nMeetings\n\tYou can log into www.webex.com with your personal or corporate account. From here you can host or join a meeting.\n\tWebex Agenda tips\n\t\nBest Practices\n\tFigure everything out BEFORE you first hold a WebEx with your sponsor! Hold one between two students or between the team and your Project Engineer. Do this in one of the conference spaces so that you know how the TV / speakerphone all work. Please do not try to learn this during the call!\n\tHave only 1 PC connected to the meeting! This saves bandwidth. Everyone in the room should be looking at the TV monitor not their laptop.\n\tIf you do not need it, turn off video at both ends. This conserves bandwidth for screen sharing and, if needed, audio. If you want to see each other, start the meeting with video on, go through introductions, then turn it off.\n\tIf you are using WebEx for sound because the sponsor needs it, it is generally better to share the presentation rather than have the sponsor paging through the slides at their end. You have WebEx open anyway - use it! Unless the sponsor has a preference not to, of course.\n\t\nScreen Sharing\n\tBe sure you are sharing the screen you think you are! You can change which screen is shared.\n\tMake the cursor easy to see.  For Windows 10, change the size and color of your cursor from Easy of Access Cursor & Pointer.\n\tIt is easiest to duplicate your desktop so that you and the WebEx \"see\" the same thing. Avoid PowerPoint Presenter Mode by unchecking the Use Presentation View option in the Slide Show tab.\n\tDo not point to a projector screen or TV. Use a mouse as a Laser Pointer under the Slide Show mode: Right Click -> Pointer Options -> Laser Pointer or Holding Ctl and Left Mouse Button.\n\t\nUse a Speaker Phone\n\tWhenever possible, use the speakerphone for the best audio!\n\tSpread out the satellite microphones. Do not place them \"behind\" laptop screens or next to the fans on the laptops.\n\tIf there are no satellite microphones, then the speaker MUST step over to the phone to be heard. Note that the rest of the team / room will generally NOT be heard!\n\t\nSpeaker Phone Not Available\n\tConnect the \"master PC\" (the one that is doing the sharing) to the TV's via HDMI. This will let the audio come from the better speakers in the TV.\n\tDo NOT have two PC's in the same room connected to the meeting with their microphones OR speakers on. Contrary to expectations - it does NOT help! In fact it leads to feedback and echoing. WebEx handles sound fine within a single PC connection but is not capable of doing so across multiple PC's.\n\tThere is a single jack on most laptops. This is NOT a headphone jack although most people assume so. It is actually a combination headphone / microphone jack. It will accept any earbud or headphone / mic unit designed for cell phones. It will also accept a plan headphone or external speakers. It will NOT accept an external microphone without a special Y adapter! This adapter will break out the combination jack into two separate jacks - one for headphones (usually colored / marked green) and one for a microphone (usually colored / marked red). Then you may plug in an external microphone. Note that in several experiments the internal laptop mic has proven to be equally capable to an external onmi-directional mic (i.e. the common kind). Connecting an external mic to this jack will usually disconnect the internal mic - so you do not get \"satellite\" mic capability as might be expected.\n\tAlternatively, Junichi has a USB audio module that provides separate mic and headphone jacks. It is possible that this might allow the simultaneous use of both an internal and an external mic.\n\tThe lab does have a couple external microphones - both dynamic and electret. The electret style (as used in all cell phones and laptops) has a stronger output and is preferred.\n\tUsing more than one microphone with a laptop requires an external mixer - which the lab currently (F2019) does not have.\n\t\nCalls\n\t\nTeams\n\t\nQuick Guide\n\t\nAdvanced Topics\n\tThese links are to Webex or YouTube pages.\n\t\n\tPeoples Availability\n\t\tFilter Your Spaces and Content\n\t\tChoose Your Audio and Video Settings Before You Join a Meeting\n\t\tShare Screen or App\n\t\tScreen Capture\n\t\tCreate a Whiteboard in a Space\n\t\n\tIf you do not see a pencil icon at the top-left corner of a shared whiteboard, reinstall Webex Team. (03/25/20)\n\t\tFor iPad, choose the shared whiteboard from the Whiteboards to edit it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tFormat Messages\n\t\tAdd links for meetings or messages to an email or a web page\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/README_File": "\nREADME File - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nKnowledge Base  Subversion  \n  \nREADME File\n\tThe goal of a README file is to describe what the folder contains. It's purpose is to be USEFUL! It should explain what is in the directory and, as needed, explain why or how to use it. This way others do not have to open every file to figure out what is in each and what they are for. Although file names should be meaningful, any that are not should be commented on in the README. Don't just restate the folder name in words in the README - explain it instead!\nA useful README should indicate:\n\t\n\thow to get started with the material in that folder, for example which CAD model to open first or which file should be read before the others. A good README is somewhat of a 'getting started' guide to that folder.  \n\t\tThe purpose of the directory, i.e., type of information stored.\n\t\tSoftware used and versions \n\t\tList of sub-directories and files stored.\n\t\tWhere / how to get started using the folder's contents. For example if there is a program in the folder, quick start instructions on how to run it would be very helpful in the README.\n\t\nEXCEPTIONS: \n\t\n\tSome software development tools generate many files and folders as part of 'compiling' or 'building' an application. These folders are dynamic and do not require README files.\n\t\tSome software applications may process entire folders of data at a time. The presence of a README file may break the code. In these cases, the README can be left out of that data folder but the README for the folder one level up should provide the explanations.\n\t\n\tGenerally README files are plain text files NOT WORD documents. That way they are readable even from a terminal / DOS session and don't require special software to access. A template (README.txt) is available. Please AVOID using Markdown format as that is NOT pre-installed on our computers! Yes, we know it provides very nice looking output. We know that it's free to download one or more tools to use it. But we already have a tool that is pre-loaded on our PC's and produces nicely formatted output. It's called Microsoft Word! Use plain text files for README files. If you need more, the information probably should be in the wiki! Or you really need some sort of user manual which would be best created in Word due to its full formatting capabilities.\n\tA sample README file for Final Report is shown below. If different files were created using different versions of the software (for example Microsoft Word 2013 vs. 2016 - then that needs to be noted on a folder by folder or file by file basis. Be sure to include the operating system and it's version as some teams use things other than Windows. Avoid fancy indenting - this is a plain text file and multiple indents quickly make the file hard to read.\nThis directory contains project reports.\nSoftware Used:\n    Windows 7, Ver.

It meets the Design Lab's needs better than the alternatives.To compare to other systems/software that students typically request instead:\nWhy Forums & Repository beat out Google Docs\n\t\n\tAccountability - Difficult to tease out which team member contributed what part of a document\n\t\tContinuity, longevity - lose the link, or accidental deletion of entire document\n\t\tSecurity - Google terms of service allow them full search with free product\n\t\tVersion control - no easy way to understand WHY changes were made\n\t\nWhy MS Office & Repository beat out Office Online & Box/Dropbox/OneCloud\n\t\n\tMicrosoft Online products are crippled for many features needed for documentation\n\t\n\tWord Online - POOR or no support of headings, table of contents, numbered lists, citations, bibliography\n\t\tPowerPoint Online - cannot integrate Excel charts, no header/footer\n\t\n\t\nWhy Forums & Repository beat out chat, email and text messages\n\t\n\tThreaded nature of conversation not preserved\n\t\tDeletion and reply-all vs. reply-one issues\n\t\tChats are not archived to become part of a project's permanent history\n\t\nWhy Issues beat out Microsoft Project\n\t\n\tAccessibility - not all students, faculty, and staff have MS Project installed\n\t\tTeam work - full team (students, instructors, sponsor) should be able to access and modify\n\t\tAuto-updates of Gantt chart\n\t\tDatabase vs. continuous updating of file\n\t\n\tAnd if none of that convinces you that our choice makes sense, we can only offer this:\n\tOn day 1 of class, you signed a legal document that you would use only the EDN for all project related work. If Design Lab was a company, a true \"industry experience\" and not a class, you could potentially get arrested and/or fired on day 2 when you used Google Docs or other alternative. You are welcome to take another course, but those are the rules here.\n\tRedmine software was not written by RPI, but is a freeware package.

Remember email is a reflection of who you are.  If your email is disorganized and filled with mistakes, your recipient will likely think of you as disorganized and careless.  Below are some tips to create effective emails:\n\t\n\tBe sure to begin all emails with a greeting like Dear Professor Smith, or Hello Ms. Jones.\n\t\tDO NOT WRITE YOUR EMAILS IN CAPITALS, they present an ANGRY tone\n\t\tIntroduce yourself.  Dont assume that your recipient remembers meeting you; offer a reminder of who you are.\n\t\tInclude the message thread so your recipient can read the history of the conversation without having to search their inbox.\n\t\tKeep your correspondence short.  Clearly state the intentions of your email in a sentence or two.\n\t\tAvoid replying with a one word response.  Be sure to reread the original email to make sure you have answered all questions.\n\t\tAvoid personal attacks in email.\n\t\tReply in a reasonable amount of time.  Responding within 24 hours is preferable considering students are expected to check their email daily.\n\t\tAlways, always, always reread your email before clicking send.\n\t\n\t[reprinted from MANE 2023 Handbook, Rev. 2019 June 11 - https://eng.rpi.edu/sites/default/files/handbooks/class-of-2023/MANE_2023AdvisingBooklet.pdf ]\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Spring_2019_Scheduled_Calls_and_Sponsor_Visits": "\nSpring 2019 Scheduled Calls and Sponsor Visits - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nSponsor Calls and Visits  Scheduled Calls - Previous Semesters  \n  \nSpring 2019 Scheduled Calls and Sponsor Visits\n\tNote only your Project Engineer can update this page.

\nPurchasing Process\n\tGraphic below shows the process to get something purchased for a Capstone project. Flowchart describes full process from having an idea to the item arriving in your hands. There is generally no need for students to buy anything with personal money. Project Engineer review and approval is required at numerous steps to ensure actions are useful to the project and time/money is not wasted along the way.\n\t\n\tWhy we go through this process is described here - Project_Engineers-Purchasing\n\t\tHow the process goes is described in pretty graphics below\n\t\n\tOr as a non-sexy numbered list here - Purchased_Part_Process_numbered.docx (Content is the same.)\n\t\n\t\n\t\tList of RPI Approved Vendors can be found here - Purchasing_Guidelines\n\t\n\t\n  Files (2)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Purchased_Part_Flowchart_graphic.png    (256 KB)\n    Purchased_Part_Flowchart_graphic.png  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2018-08-21 03:45 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Purchased_Part_Process_numbered.docx    (14.7 KB)\n    Purchased_Part_Process_numbered.docx  \n  \n  \n      Aren Paster, 2018-08-21 03:45 PM\n  \n  \n  \n  \n      \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/CE_not_this_semester": "\nCE not this semester - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.');

should have a clear plan for your visit:\n\t\n\twhat do you want to present?\n\t\twhat do you want to demo?\n\t\twhat do you want to learn from your visit?\n\t\n\t\nTypical Challenges\n\t\n\tYou may not have internet access - WiFi OR wired!\n\t\tMany companies ban the use of thumb drives / USB disks as they can spread malware. If you need to carry files, you'll need to bring a CD or DVD.\n\t\tThe projection system may not have your specific connector type! Some sites have only VGA, some may have HDMI. Many do not have any of the other choices. Be sure to bring any dongles required to interface your laptop to various connectors.\n\t\n\t\nPresentation / Demo\n\t\n\tBe sure it's been thoroughly reviewed with your Project Engineer\n\t\tBe sure all files are posted on EDN. Even if you don't have network access your sponsor probably does\n\t\tBe sure you have everything needed to conduct your demo(s). This may include sample parts, images, printouts, external web cams, etc.\n\t\tIf there are critical material that need to be shared in hardcopy, be sure to print/bring those!\n\t\tRecord all your demos - just in case! At least you can play those videos in the event of system issues.\n\t\tBe sure to use & follow the guidelines found in Creating Strong PowerPoint Presentations!\n\t\n  Files (0)\n  \n  \n        \n        \n    \n    Powered by Redmine  2006-2020 Jean-Philippe Lang\nLoading...\n", "https://designlab.eng.rpi.edu/edn/projects/capstone-support-dev/wiki/Spring_2017_Scheduled_Calls_and_Sponsor_Visits": "\nSpring 2017 Scheduled Calls and Sponsor Visits - Capstone Support - The Design Lab at Rensselaer - Electronic Design Notebook\n//<![CDATA[\n$(window).on('load', function(){ warnLeavingUnsaved('The current page contains unsaved text that will be lost if you leave this page.'); });\n//]]>\n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        Project\n        \n    General\n    \n    \n    Profile\n    \n    \n        Sign inRegister    \n    \n    HomeProjectsHelp\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          Search:\n        \n        \n        Capstone SupportAll Projects\n    \n    Capstone Support\n    \n        OverviewActivityNewsWikiRepository\n        \n            \n            \n        \n    \n    \n          \nWiki\n  Start page\n  Index by title\n  Index by date\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n  \n  \n  \nSponsor Calls and Visits  Scheduled Calls - Previous Semesters  \n  \nSpring 2017 Scheduled Calls and Sponsor Visits\n\t\nSection 1 (M & Th 10:00 am - 11:50 am)Section 2 (M & Th 12:00 noon - 1:50 pm)Section 3 (Tu & F 10:00 am - 11:50 am)Section 4 (Tu & F 12:00 noon - 1:50 pm)\n\tPlease keep the list below sorted by date!
