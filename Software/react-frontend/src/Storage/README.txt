The Database applies two approaches: the react frontend which invokes REST API(written in JS, to be uploaded under component folder) 
to add, delete or display data from MySQL database, and the python files over here to add/delete/update/select with more
features available. 
Also the NLP sub folder uses BERT with sentence transformer to categorize data
Please use following commands to install frameworks needed
