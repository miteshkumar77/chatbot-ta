## 1. Chatbot Interface
To be used to interact with the chatbot. Simply type messages in the textbox that appears towards the bottom of the screen and either press the enter key, or press the send button to send your message to the chatbot. Wait for a response and if further action or information is needed, take that action or provide that information in order to get the answer to the question you asked. Press the rest button in order to reset the chatbot back to the beginning of an interaction and begin the process over again.

## 2. Advanced Search
To be used as an advanced search tool that is more refined and gives better results than the EDN website's search tool. While the EDN search page uses reverse chronological order and exact keyword matching to return information, this advanced search tool returns 5 pages from the EDN wiki that contain information that is either an exact match to the query or synonomous with keywords from the query. Page relevance is used to determine the pages that are most likely to answer the question provided.

## 3. Instructor Dashboard
This page is used for instructors to determine the status of the student class and help with determining areas of need. The query logs are categorized and group together based on similarity between the queries, and are separated for both the chatbot and the advanced search. This can be used to determine what types of questions are being asked the most and perhaps what information is not in an easy place to find on EDN and that information can be added or moved so that it is more accessable.

## 4. Future Work
Some ideas that can be implemented by future semesters:

1. Add code to mark a query as unanswerable if both the chatbot and advanced search cannot come up with a satisfactory answer.
2. Add a feedback interface that allows the user to report bugs and other feedback about the system so that bugs can be fixed and more features that are requested can be added in the future.
